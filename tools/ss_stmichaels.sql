What''s the story? is based upon elements of           the Montessori method and has been primarily developed by Jerome Berryman.           You can find a good overview in the book Young Children in Worship, by           Jerome Berryman and Sonja M. Stewart (this is the book is also used to begin         the classes).

Building of the church started in 1912 and the foundation       stone was laid in 1919. This stone is a block of marble inscribed with a       Maltese Cross and the year given in Roman numerals, MCMXIX and can be found       at the east end of the church on St Michael’s Crescent. This event is       recorded in the National Library archives of the Evening Post.</p>\n<p>In 1940 a strong earthquake irrecoverably damaged the nave (main section of       the church where the pews are). Despite war time austerity that part of the       church was rebuilt by 1942. Further strengthening of the brick work wasn’t       carried out until 2002!</p>\n<h4>Banners</h4>\n<p>The four fabric banners hanging over the nave of St Michael’s were designed       and made by Bridget Chapman, who was a parishioner, and installed during the       late 1980’s. They speak of the great biblical themes of creation, redemption       and the coming of the Spirit. The larger work hanging on the west wall above       the entrance to the nave, was designed and executed by Beverley Shore       Bennett, who also designed several of the stained glass windows in our       church (see more below on Beverly).</p>\n<p>You can read about the dedication by Mrs Anne Davidson of this wall-hanging       as a memorial to her husband George Davidson on page 112 (and some       historically relevant comment on page 94) of Joan Wood’s book St Michael and       All Angels, Kelburn Copies of which you can find in the narthex (foyer).       Feel free to keep one. In the book, the work is also referred to as a       “tapestry” on pages 112 and 116, though the usual description was       “wall-hanging”.</p>\n<p>In 1968 Beverley Shore Bennet also designed and executed the Bible Class       banner of St. Michael that stands on a wooden support in the chancel of our       church. This replaces an earlier one by her of one that was stolen in 1967       but retains the style of the original.</p>\n<h4>Windows</h4>\n<p>The stained glass windows in St. Michael’s range in date from 1921 to the       early 1980s. The ten windows fall loosely into two groups: those of English       origin installed during the foundation of the church in the 1920s and those       designed and made mainly in New Zealand, installed from the late 1960s to       the early 1980s, with the remaining window installed in the 1940s. The       styles vary from the Camm Brothers’ diagonally latticed, detailed       compositions to the moments in movement that characterize Beverley Shore       Bennett’s work. Some other New Zealand examples of the work of the Camm       Brothers of Smethwick feature in Fiona Ciaran’s book The Stained Glass       Windows of Canterbury. Beverley Shore Bennett is the only New Zealand woman       to have been made a fellow of the British Society of Master Glass Painters.       She was awarded an MBE in June, 1980. She has completed over five hundred       stained glass window designs throughout New Zealand.</p>\n<p>These stained glass windows are a testament to individuals and communities       associated with St. Michael’s Church over almost a century. They are gifts,       memorials and heritage works, mostly featuring Biblical narratives designed       to teach and inspire. The church architect, Edmund Wilson, wrote of his       desire for the first stained glass windows to be “appropriate in feeling” to       the design of the building. Although stylistically very different,       subsequent windows, echo this sentiment, with the overriding aim of       glorifying God. In Walter Camm’s words, “a window should be not only       beautiful in its detail, but an inspiration to all beholders for all time.”       Beverley Shore Bennett’s consistent approach, in her own words, “has the       starting point of prayer and what follows is God given.”</p>\n<p>If you want to study the windows further – either here in at the church –       the following details may be of use to you…</p>\n<h4>East wall windows – the chancel</h4>\n<p>The church architect, Edmund Wilson of Invercargill, in 1920, expressed a       dual purpose for the stained glass windows of St. Michael’s. His desire was       that they should both be striking works of art and inspire worship. To       Arthur Dixon, in June, Wilson wrote of “getting a result worthy of its high       purpose in these troublous times.” He further wrote of his desire that the       windows should “arrest the attention of the worshippers as they enter the       church.”</p>\n<p>“Lord Bledisloe, a former Governor-General, always maintained that the       finest stained glass in New Zealand was in St. Michael’s.” This comment       relates specifically to the East window and the St. Michael window, and was       made after a visit made in the early 1950s. (This is according to the       unknown writer of St. Michael’s Church, a spiral bound, Croxley ‘Li-Flat’       school exercise book in the Alexander Turnbull Library).</p>\n<h4>The Nativity (The Holy Family and the Shepherds) – east wall, the chancel</h4>\n<p>While they were there (Bethlehem), the time came for her to deliver her       child. And she gave birth to her first born son and wrapped him in bands of       cloth, and laid him in a manger because there was no place for them in the     inn.<span class="smallitalicp"> Luke 2: 6-7</span></p>\n<p>The central light, unveiled in 1921, was given by Mrs Edward Anderson, in       memory of her husband who died in 1919. All three windows were designed by       Walter Camm and executed by Florence, Robert and Walter Camm, for the firm       of Thomas William Camm, The Studio, Smethwick, England. The two sidelights       were unveiled on 30 August 1925. The left light was a parting gift from the       Reverend Arthur Payne and the right was a gift of the Sunday School       children, in memory of those killed in the Great War.</p>\n<p>In the Evening Post, 29 August 1925, an article appears detailing the       unveiling of the windows. It carefully describes the portrayal of the       subject, including the naturalistic detail of “St. Joseph’s sandals thrown       off as he enters the manger.” The article concludes that “the window is       remarkable for the richness of its colour and harmony of tones, and as a       whole depicts the sacred subject of the Nativity with noble reverence and       symbolism full of beautiful meaning.”</p>\n<p>In correspondence between the Reverend Arthur Payne and Walter Camm, some       confusion about the cost was discussed, as the estimate omitted the word       ‘each.’ Walter Camm expressed alarm at “the preposterous duty on British       stained glass for New Zealand.” Also that “since the war, expenses have       increased by leaps and bounds in all directions.” Allowances were made and       the two side lights with bronze saddle bars duly arrived on the R.M.S       Tainui.</p>\n<p><a rel="prettyPhoto[gallery]" href="assets/history-photos/nativityscene.jpg"><img src="assets/history-photos/nativityscene2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></a></p>\n<h4>Touch Me Not, Rabboni – north wall, the nave</h4>\n<p>Jesus said to her, “Do not hold on to me, because I have not yet ascended to       the father.”<span class="smallitalicp"> John 20:17</span></p>\n<p>This double pane depicts The Risen Christ and Mary Magdalene, who emerge       from a pale gold, decorative background. It was given by Mr and Mrs H.C.       Gibbons in memory of their sons, Edward and Walter, killed in the Great War.       It was ordered by the Reverend Arthur Payne, at a total cost of two hundred       and fifty pounds. (Payne retired in August, 1925.) The letter of       authenticity and certification is dated June, 1922. Payne was delighted by       “the simple, though beautiful design, without elaborate details or treatment       of the subject.”</p>\n<p>In St. Michael’s Church, however, the writer wonders why the work was       carried out by James Powell and Sons, Whitefriars, London, instead of the       Camm brothers. He goes on to describe the window as “stereotyped, with       commercialised colour”, and Mary’s purple robe as “quite horrible.” He       wonders at the appropriateness of the design for two young men killed in       action.</p>\n<p>Mr Gibbons, donor of the window, visited James Powell and Sons on 15       December 1921. In a letter to Payne, dated 25 September 1922, from       Bournemouth, Mr Gibbons expresses his clear delight at the finished windows.       “It is difficult for me to express all we feel with regard to the whole of       your arrangements, great thoughtfulness and kindnesses in connection with       the glorious ceremony of the unveiling of the memorial window to our boys.”       The letter is written in a large, flowing script over several backed pages.       Mr Gibbons died on 13 March 1941.</p>\n<p><a rel="prettyPhoto[gallery]" href="assets/history-photos/Jesusandmary.jpg"><img src="assets/history-photos/Jesusandmary2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></a></p>\n<h4>St. Michael in Armour – south wall, the chancel</h4>\n<p>“And war broke out in Heaven; Michael and his angels fought against the       dragon.”<span class="smallitalicp"> Revelation 12: 7</span></p>\n<p>The St. Michael window occupies the traditional place for the name window.       It was unveiled on 2 October 1927. The design chosen was a portion of a       window done in memory of the squire of Meriden parish, near Coventry,       England – Captain Bankes, who was killed in the retreat from Mons.</p>\n<p>The original drawing was painted by Florence Camm, with the assistance of       Robert and Walter Camm. In the draft history of the parish, the subject is       described as St Michael “striking down the dragon which symbolises the power       of evil.”</p>\n<p><a rel="prettyPhoto[gallery]" href="assets/history-photos/stmicheals.jpg"><img src="assets/history-photos/stmicheals2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></a></p>\n<h4>Blessed are the Pure – north wall, the chancel</h4>\n<p>“Blessed are the pure in heart for they will see God.”<span class="smallitalicp"> Matthew 5:8</span></p>\n<p>This is the only window in St. Michael’s that does not have a Biblical       narrative for its subject. Dedicated in March, 1944, the Flanagan window was       erected in memory of their daughter Shirley Isobel, who died in 1939, aged       19.</p>\n<p>Walter Camm, who manufactured the window, described its subject as “Blessed       are the pure in heart for they shall see God.” He further related the       subject to Shirley in the Madonna lilies representing purity, the spinning       wheel, domestic duties and the medallion of harp and scroll to Shirley’s       musical tastes and talents.</p>\n<p><a rel="prettyPhoto[gallery]" href="assets/history-photos/Blessedarethepure.jpg"><img src="assets/history-photos/Blessedarethepure2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></a></p>\n<h4>St. Raphael – south wall, the chancel</h4>\n<p>“I am one of the seven holy angels, which present the prayers of the saints,       and go in before the glory of the Holy One.” <span class="smallitalicp">Tobit 12:15</span></p>\n<p>Given by Mrs Evelyn Marsack in memory of her son Nigel and of her parents,       Frank and Etta Robins. It was made in 1980, by Paul Hutchins of Miller       Studios in Dunedin, and dedicated in 1981. The window depicts St. Raphael,       one of the three archangels named in the Jewish scriptures. In the story of       Tobit, Raphael uses a fish that is caught to both heal and repel evil.</p>\n<p>Symbolically, the fish can also represent the church, the Greek word IXTHUS       meaning both ‘fish’ and the words “Jesus Christ son of God Saviour”. Both       the shoulder pouch and the medical symbol in the bottom left corner refer to       his ministry of healing. St. Raphael steps towards us in swirling garments,       characteristic of Beverley Shore Bennett’s style and what she describes as       her “swoops and swishes”.</p>\n<p><a rel="prettyPhoto[gallery]" href="assets/history-photos/raphael.jpg"><img src="assets/history-photos/raphael2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></a></p>\n<h4>The Prodigal Son (I am the Good Shepherd) – south wall, the nave</h4>\n<p>“This son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found!”<span class="smallitalicp"> Luke 15:24</span></p>\n<p>Gifted by Mr and Mrs George Davidson in memory of their parents. The window       was dedicated by the Bishop of Wellington, on Jubilee Sunday, 1 October       1967, fifty years after St. Michael’s was declared a parochial district.</p>\n<p>The windows were designed by Mr Pilgrim Wheton and made in Australia. They       depict the Prodigal Son and The Good Shepherd. The style is linear, with       stylised figures presented with bright clarity. In the two windows beside       this, Beverley Shore Bennett consciously followed the same compositional       format of a series of frames.</p>\n<p><a rel="prettyPhoto[gallery]" href="assets/history-photos/prodigalson.jpg"><img src="assets/history-photos/prodigalson2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></a></p>\n<h4>The Good Samaritan (The True Vine, Love One Another) – south wall, the nave</h4>\n<p>“But a Samaritan while travelling came near him; and when he saw him, he was       moved with pity.”<span class="smallitalicp"> Luke 10:33</span></p>\n<p>This window was gifted by Mrs Maude Haines in memory of John Frederick Mayo,       acting vicar (August 1940-April 1946). It was dedicated by Bishop MacKenzie       at the Patronal Festival, 26 September 1971. The window was designed by       Beverley Shore Bennett, who arranged for its manufacture by Roy Miller of       Miller and Sons, Dunedin. The windows depict the story of The Good Samaritan       in four circular frames. Biblical text features throughout the windows, with       the new commandment to “love one another” at the top. The windows present       both a central truth in Christ’s teaching as well as a tribute to the life       and work of Mayo.</p>\n<p><a rel="prettyPhoto[gallery]" href="assets/history-photos/goodsamaritan.jpg"><img src="assets/history-photos/goodsamaritan2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></a></p>\n<h4>The Parable of the Sower (Secrets of the Kingdom of God, The Mustard Seed) –       south wall, the nave</h4>\n<p>“But as for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word       and understands it, who indeed bears fruit.” <span class="smallitalicp">Matthew 13:23</span></p>\n<p>Installed in 1981, this window is in memory of Dorothy Cowell Hentry and was       paid for out of her generous legacy. This window depicts the parable of the       sower and what that parable reveals about the Kingdom of Heaven. Biblical       text is interspersed between the frames. It echoes the simple design of The       Prodigal Son in its storybook format. The windows were designed by Beverley       Shore Bennett and made by Paul Hutchins of Miller Studios, Dunedin.</p>\n<p><a rel="prettyPhoto[gallery]" href="assets/history-photos/sower.jpg"><img src="assets/history-photos/sower2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></a></p>\n<h4>The Crucifixion (Truly this was the Son of God) – north wall, the nave</h4>\n<p>Now when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that in this way he       breathed his last, he said, “Truly this man was God’s son!”<span class="smallitalicp"> Mark 15:39</span></p>\n<p>This window depicts the crucified Christ on a dramatic red background. The       contrasting left panel is predominantly rich blues, focussed in Mary’s       garment. The window is in memory of Maude Haines who died on the 29       September 1971, her bequest covering most of the cost of the narthex. The       vestry decided to place another window in St. Michael’s, “a project dear to       the heart of Mrs Haines.” The window was installed and consecrated in       1975/6.</p>\n<p>The coloured drawing (watercolour) for the Crucifixion windows, designed by       Beverley Shore Bennett, is in the Alexander Turnbull Library.       Characteristically, the lead is clearly a part of the design and relates to       the subject for effect, rather than functioning independently. As a result,       both sides are connected and flow into each other. The windows were made by       Roy Miller of Miller Studios, Dunedin. Roy Miller retired in 1981.</p>\n<p><a rel="prettyPhoto[gallery]" href="assets/history-photos/CRUCIFIXION.jpg"><img src="assets/history-photos/CRUCIFIXION2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></a></p>\n<h4>The Transfiguration (Jesus Appears, The Disciples) – north wall, the nave</h4>\n<p>“Jesus took with him Peter and James and his brother John and led them up a       high mountain by themselves. And he was transfigured before them, and his       face shone like the sun, and his clothes became dazzling white.”<span class="smallitalicp"> Matthew       17:1-2</span></p>\n<p>The window is dedicated to Max Willacy-Kuhn (11 September 1904 – 24 February       1975). It was designed by Beverley Shore Bennett and installed towards the       end of 1977 by his widow and family. Mrs Elizabeth Wallacy-Kuhn described       the subject of the Transfiguration as “a powerful symbol of the emergent,       immaculate Christ”. Personal detail is also reflected in the choice of the       predominant blue, Mr Willacy-Kuhn’s favourite colour, in contrast with the       “homespun brown colours of the kneeling disciples”, so bringing heaven and       earth together.</p>\n<p><a rel="prettyPhoto[gallery]" href="assets/history-photos/transfigaration.jpg"><img src="assets/history-photos/transfigaration2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></a></p>', 'History', NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, 1, NULL, 0, 1, 1, 0, 'Published', NULL, 'Inherit', 'Inherit', NULL, 12, 29);

Building of the church started in 1912 and the foundation       stone was laid in 1919. This stone is a block of marble inscribed with a       Maltese Cross and the year given in Roman numerals, MCMXIX and can be found       at the east end of the church on St Michael’s Crescent. This event is       recorded in the National Library archives of the Evening Post.</p>\n<p>In 1940 a strong earthquake irrecoverably damaged the nave (main section of       the church where the pews are). Despite war time austerity that part of the       church was rebuilt by 1942. Further strengthening of the brick work wasn’t       carried out until 2002!</p>\n<h4>Banners</h4>\n<p>The four fabric banners hanging over the nave of St Michael’s were designed       and made by Bridget Chapman, who was a parishioner, and installed during the       late 1980’s. They speak of the great biblical themes of creation, redemption       and the coming of the Spirit. The larger work hanging on the west wall above       the entrance to the nave, was designed and executed by Beverley Shore       Bennett, who also designed several of the stained glass windows in our       church (see more below on Beverly).</p>\n<p>You can read about the dedication by Mrs Anne Davidson of this wall-hanging       as a memorial to her husband George Davidson on page 112 (and some       historically relevant comment on page 94) of Joan Wood’s book St Michael and       All Angels, Kelburn Copies of which you can find in the narthex (foyer).       Feel free to keep one. In the book, the work is also referred to as a       “tapestry” on pages 112 and 116, though the usual description was       “wall-hanging”.</p>\n<p>In 1968 Beverley Shore Bennet also designed and executed the Bible Class       banner of St. Michael that stands on a wooden support in the chancel of our       church. This replaces an earlier one by her of one that was stolen in 1967       but retains the style of the original.</p>\n<h4>Windows</h4>\n<p>The stained glass windows in St. Michael’s range in date from 1921 to the       early 1980s. The ten windows fall loosely into two groups: those of English       origin installed during the foundation of the church in the 1920s and those       designed and made mainly in New Zealand, installed from the late 1960s to       the early 1980s, with the remaining window installed in the 1940s. The       styles vary from the Camm Brothers’ diagonally latticed, detailed       compositions to the moments in movement that characterize Beverley Shore       Bennett’s work. Some other New Zealand examples of the work of the Camm       Brothers of Smethwick feature in Fiona Ciaran’s book The Stained Glass       Windows of Canterbury. Beverley Shore Bennett is the only New Zealand woman       to have been made a fellow of the British Society of Master Glass Painters.       She was awarded an MBE in June, 1980. She has completed over five hundred       stained glass window designs throughout New Zealand.</p>\n<p>These stained glass windows are a testament to individuals and communities       associated with St. Michael’s Church over almost a century. They are gifts,       memorials and heritage works, mostly featuring Biblical narratives designed       to teach and inspire. The church architect, Edmund Wilson, wrote of his       desire for the first stained glass windows to be “appropriate in feeling” to       the design of the building. Although stylistically very different,       subsequent windows, echo this sentiment, with the overriding aim of       glorifying God. In Walter Camm’s words, “a window should be not only       beautiful in its detail, but an inspiration to all beholders for all time.”       Beverley Shore Bennett’s consistent approach, in her own words, “has the       starting point of prayer and what follows is God given.”</p>\n<p>If you want to study the windows further – either here in at the church –       the following details may be of use to you…</p>\n<h4>East wall windows – the chancel</h4>\n<p>The church architect, Edmund Wilson of Invercargill, in 1920, expressed a       dual purpose for the stained glass windows of St. Michael’s. His desire was       that they should both be striking works of art and inspire worship. To       Arthur Dixon, in June, Wilson wrote of “getting a result worthy of its high       purpose in these troublous times.” He further wrote of his desire that the       windows should “arrest the attention of the worshippers as they enter the       church.”</p>\n<p>“Lord Bledisloe, a former Governor-General, always maintained that the       finest stained glass in New Zealand was in St. Michael’s.” This comment       relates specifically to the East window and the St. Michael window, and was       made after a visit made in the early 1950s. (This is according to the       unknown writer of St. Michael’s Church, a spiral bound, Croxley ‘Li-Flat’       school exercise book in the Alexander Turnbull Library).</p>\n<h4>The Nativity (The Holy Family and the Shepherds) – east wall, the chancel</h4>\n<p>While they were there (Bethlehem), the time came for her to deliver her       child. And she gave birth to her first born son and wrapped him in bands of       cloth, and laid him in a manger because there was no place for them in the     inn.<span class="smallitalicp"> Luke 2: 6-7</span></p>\n<p>The central light, unveiled in 1921, was given by Mrs Edward Anderson, in       memory of her husband who died in 1919. All three windows were designed by       Walter Camm and executed by Florence, Robert and Walter Camm, for the firm       of Thomas William Camm, The Studio, Smethwick, England. The two sidelights       were unveiled on 30 August 1925. The left light was a parting gift from the       Reverend Arthur Payne and the right was a gift of the Sunday School       children, in memory of those killed in the Great War.</p>\n<p>In the Evening Post, 29 August 1925, an article appears detailing the       unveiling of the windows. It carefully describes the portrayal of the       subject, including the naturalistic detail of “St. Joseph’s sandals thrown       off as he enters the manger.” The article concludes that “the window is       remarkable for the richness of its colour and harmony of tones, and as a       whole depicts the sacred subject of the Nativity with noble reverence and       symbolism full of beautiful meaning.”</p>\n<p>In correspondence between the Reverend Arthur Payne and Walter Camm, some       confusion about the cost was discussed, as the estimate omitted the word       ‘each.’ Walter Camm expressed alarm at “the preposterous duty on British       stained glass for New Zealand.” Also that “since the war, expenses have       increased by leaps and bounds in all directions.” Allowances were made and       the two side lights with bronze saddle bars duly arrived on the R.M.S       Tainui.</p>\n<p><a rel="prettyPhoto[gallery]" href="assets/history-photos/nativityscene.jpg"><img src="assets/history-photos/nativityscene2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></a></p>\n<h4>Touch Me Not, Rabboni – north wall, the nave</h4>\n<p>Jesus said to her, “Do not hold on to me, because I have not yet ascended to       the father.”<span class="smallitalicp"> John 20:17</span></p>\n<p>This double pane depicts The Risen Christ and Mary Magdalene, who emerge       from a pale gold, decorative background. It was given by Mr and Mrs H.C.       Gibbons in memory of their sons, Edward and Walter, killed in the Great War.       It was ordered by the Reverend Arthur Payne, at a total cost of two hundred       and fifty pounds. (Payne retired in August, 1925.) The letter of       authenticity and certification is dated June, 1922. Payne was delighted by       “the simple, though beautiful design, without elaborate details or treatment       of the subject.”</p>\n<p>In St. Michael’s Church, however, the writer wonders why the work was       carried out by James Powell and Sons, Whitefriars, London, instead of the       Camm brothers. He goes on to describe the window as “stereotyped, with       commercialised colour”, and Mary’s purple robe as “quite horrible.” He       wonders at the appropriateness of the design for two young men killed in       action.</p>\n<p>Mr Gibbons, donor of the window, visited James Powell and Sons on 15       December 1921. In a letter to Payne, dated 25 September 1922, from       Bournemouth, Mr Gibbons expresses his clear delight at the finished windows.       “It is difficult for me to express all we feel with regard to the whole of       your arrangements, great thoughtfulness and kindnesses in connection with       the glorious ceremony of the unveiling of the memorial window to our boys.”       The letter is written in a large, flowing script over several backed pages.       Mr Gibbons died on 13 March 1941.</p>\n<p><a rel="prettyPhoto[gallery]" href="assets/history-photos/Jesusandmary.jpg"><img src="assets/history-photos/Jesusandmary2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></a></p>\n<h4>St. Michael in Armour – south wall, the chancel</h4>\n<p>“And war broke out in Heaven; Michael and his angels fought against the       dragon.”<span class="smallitalicp"> Revelation 12: 7</span></p>\n<p>The St. Michael window occupies the traditional place for the name window.       It was unveiled on 2 October 1927. The design chosen was a portion of a       window done in memory of the squire of Meriden parish, near Coventry,       England – Captain Bankes, who was killed in the retreat from Mons.</p>\n<p>The original drawing was painted by Florence Camm, with the assistance of       Robert and Walter Camm. In the draft history of the parish, the subject is       described as St Michael “striking down the dragon which symbolises the power       of evil.”</p>\n<p><a rel="prettyPhoto[gallery]" href="assets/history-photos/stmicheals.jpg"><img src="assets/history-photos/stmicheals2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></a></p>\n<h4>Blessed are the Pure – north wall, the chancel</h4>\n<p>“Blessed are the pure in heart for they will see God.”<span class="smallitalicp"> Matthew 5:8</span></p>\n<p>This is the only window in St. Michael’s that does not have a Biblical       narrative for its subject. Dedicated in March, 1944, the Flanagan window was       erected in memory of their daughter Shirley Isobel, who died in 1939, aged       19.</p>\n<p>Walter Camm, who manufactured the window, described its subject as “Blessed       are the pure in heart for they shall see God.” He further related the       subject to Shirley in the Madonna lilies representing purity, the spinning       wheel, domestic duties and the medallion of harp and scroll to Shirley’s       musical tastes and talents.</p>\n<p><a rel="prettyPhoto[gallery]" href="assets/history-photos/Blessedarethepure.jpg"><img src="assets/history-photos/Blessedarethepure2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></a></p>\n<h4>St. Raphael – south wall, the chancel</h4>\n<p>“I am one of the seven holy angels, which present the prayers of the saints,       and go in before the glory of the Holy One.” <span class="smallitalicp">Tobit 12:15</span></p>\n<p>Given by Mrs Evelyn Marsack in memory of her son Nigel and of her parents,       Frank and Etta Robins. It was made in 1980, by Paul Hutchins of Miller       Studios in Dunedin, and dedicated in 1981. The window depicts St. Raphael,       one of the three archangels named in the Jewish scriptures. In the story of       Tobit, Raphael uses a fish that is caught to both heal and repel evil.</p>\n<p>Symbolically, the fish can also represent the church, the Greek word IXTHUS       meaning both ‘fish’ and the words “Jesus Christ son of God Saviour”. Both       the shoulder pouch and the medical symbol in the bottom left corner refer to       his ministry of healing. St. Raphael steps towards us in swirling garments,       characteristic of Beverley Shore Bennett’s style and what she describes as       her “swoops and swishes”.</p>\n<p><a rel="prettyPhoto[gallery]" href="assets/history-photos/raphael.jpg"><img src="assets/history-photos/raphael2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></a></p>\n<h4>The Prodigal Son (I am the Good Shepherd) – south wall, the nave</h4>\n<p>“This son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found!”<span class="smallitalicp"> Luke 15:24</span></p>\n<p>Gifted by Mr and Mrs George Davidson in memory of their parents. The window       was dedicated by the Bishop of Wellington, on Jubilee Sunday, 1 October       1967, fifty years after St. Michael’s was declared a parochial district.</p>\n<p>The windows were designed by Mr Pilgrim Wheton and made in Australia. They       depict the Prodigal Son and The Good Shepherd. The style is linear, with       stylised figures presented with bright clarity. In the two windows beside       this, Beverley Shore Bennett consciously followed the same compositional       format of a series of frames.</p>\n<p><a rel="prettyPhoto[gallery]" href="assets/history-photos/prodigalson.jpg"><img src="assets/history-photos/prodigalson2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></a></p>\n<h4>The Good Samaritan (The True Vine, Love One Another) – south wall, the nave</h4>\n<p>“But a Samaritan while travelling came near him; and when he saw him, he was       moved with pity.”<span class="smallitalicp"> Luke 10:33</span></p>\n<p>This window was gifted by Mrs Maude Haines in memory of John Frederick Mayo,       acting vicar (August 1940-April 1946). It was dedicated by Bishop MacKenzie       at the Patronal Festival, 26 September 1971. The window was designed by       Beverley Shore Bennett, who arranged for its manufacture by Roy Miller of       Miller and Sons, Dunedin. The windows depict the story of The Good Samaritan       in four circular frames. Biblical text features throughout the windows, with       the new commandment to “love one another” at the top. The windows present       both a central truth in Christ’s teaching as well as a tribute to the life       and work of Mayo.</p>\n<p><a rel="prettyPhoto[gallery]" href="assets/history-photos/goodsamaritan.jpg"><img src="assets/history-photos/goodsamaritan2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></a></p>\n<h4>The Parable of the Sower (Secrets of the Kingdom of God, The Mustard Seed) –       south wall, the nave</h4>\n<p>“But as for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word       and understands it, who indeed bears fruit.” <span class="smallitalicp">Matthew 13:23</span></p>\n<p>Installed in 1981, this window is in memory of Dorothy Cowell Hentry and was       paid for out of her generous legacy. This window depicts the parable of the       sower and what that parable reveals about the Kingdom of Heaven. Biblical       text is interspersed between the frames. It echoes the simple design of The       Prodigal Son in its storybook format. The windows were designed by Beverley       Shore Bennett and made by Paul Hutchins of Miller Studios, Dunedin.</p>\n<p><a rel="prettyPhoto[gallery]" href="assets/history-photos/sower.jpg"><img src="assets/history-photos/sower2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></a></p>\n<h4>The Crucifixion (Truly this was the Son of God) – north wall, the nave</h4>\n<p>Now when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that in this way he       breathed his last, he said, “Truly this man was God’s son!”<span class="smallitalicp"> Mark 15:39</span></p>\n<p>This window depicts the crucified Christ on a dramatic red background. The       contrasting left panel is predominantly rich blues, focussed in Mary’s       garment. The window is in memory of Maude Haines who died on the 29       September 1971, her bequest covering most of the cost of the narthex. The       vestry decided to place another window in St. Michael’s, “a project dear to       the heart of Mrs Haines.” The window was installed and consecrated in       1975/6.</p>\n<p>The coloured drawing (watercolour) for the Crucifixion windows, designed by       Beverley Shore Bennett, is in the Alexander Turnbull Library.       Characteristically, the lead is clearly a part of the design and relates to       the subject for effect, rather than functioning independently. As a result,       both sides are connected and flow into each other. The windows were made by       Roy Miller of Miller Studios, Dunedin. Roy Miller retired in 1981.</p>\n<p><a rel="prettyPhoto[gallery]" href="assets/history-photos/CRUCIFIXION.jpg"><img src="assets/history-photos/CRUCIFIXION2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></a></p>\n<h4>The Transfiguration (Jesus Appears, The Disciples) – north wall, the nave</h4>\n<p>“Jesus took with him Peter and James and his brother John and led them up a       high mountain by themselves. And he was transfigured before them, and his       face shone like the sun, and his clothes became dazzling white.”<span class="smallitalicp"> Matthew       17:1-2</span></p>\n<p>The window is dedicated to Max Willacy-Kuhn (11 September 1904 – 24 February       1975). It was designed by Beverley Shore Bennett and installed towards the       end of 1977 by his widow and family. Mrs Elizabeth Wallacy-Kuhn described       the subject of the Transfiguration as “a powerful symbol of the emergent,       immaculate Christ”. Personal detail is also reflected in the choice of the       predominant blue, Mr Willacy-Kuhn’s favourite colour, in contrast with the       “homespun brown colours of the kneeling disciples”, so bringing heaven and       earth together.</p>\n<p><a rel="prettyPhoto[gallery]" href="assets/history-photos/transfigaration.jpg"><img src="assets/history-photos/transfigaration2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></a></p>', 'History', NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, 1, NULL, 0, 1, 1, 0, 'Published', NULL, 'Inherit', 'Inherit', NULL, 12, 29);

What''s the story? is based upon elements of           the Montessori method and has been primarily developed by Jerome Berryman.           You can find a good overview in the book Young Children in Worship, by           Jerome Berryman and Sonja M. Stewart (this is the book is also used to begin         the classes). There are several key elements to What''s the story?</p>\n<ul><li>An emphasis on the telling of Biblical stories, using             three-dimensional figures and materials, in a way that is engaging and             memorable for the children. </li>\n<li> Carefully worded questions to encourage even very young children in             thoughtful responses. </li>\n<li>Options for the creative response of the child at every lesson:             re-telling the story themselves, drawing, playing with carefully chosen             materials and other craft activities. </li>\n<li>An emphasis on having a respectful, ordered classroom, leaving room             for everyone to participate; the belief that every child has something to             contribute. </li>\n<li>An emphasis on the Church Year and the weekly use of brief             liturgical phrases for the children to learn along with a weekly song. </li>\n<li> Encouraging parents and other interested church members to be             involved in the teaching. </li>\n</ul><p>What''s the story? is best suited to children             aged 2 - 5.  Younger             children from about 18 months can attend with a parent if the parent feels             that the child will be able to give attention.</p>', 'Sunday Schools', NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, 1, NULL, 0, 2, 0, 0, 'Saved (update)', NULL, 'Inherit', 'Inherit', NULL, 8),

They speak of the great biblical themes of creation, redemption and the coming of the Spirit. The larger work hanging on the west wall above the entrance to the nave, was designed and executed by Beverley Shore Bennett, who also designed several of the stained glass windows in our church (see more below on Beverly).</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">You can read about the dedication by Mrs Anne Davidson of this wall-hanging as a memorial to her husband George Davidson on page 112 (and some historically relevant comment on page 94) of Joan Wood’s book St Michael and All Angels, Kelburn Copies of which you can find in the narthex (foyer).

The ten windows fall loosely into two groups: those of English origin installed during the foundation of the church in the 1920s and those designed and made mainly in New Zealand, installed from the late 1960s to the early 1980s, with the remaining window installed in the 1940s. The styles vary from the Camm Brothers’ diagonally latticed, detailed compositions to the moments in movement that characterize Beverley Shore Bennett’s work. Some other New Zealand examples of the work of the Camm Brothers of Smethwick feature in Fiona Ciaran’s book The Stained Glass Windows of Canterbury. Beverley Shore Bennett is the only New Zealand woman to have been made a fellow of the British Society of Master Glass Painters. She was awarded an MBE in June, 1980. She has completed over five hundred stained glass window designs throughout New Zealand.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">These stained glass windows are a testament to individuals and communities associated with St. Michael’s Church over almost a century. They are gifts, memorials and heritage works, mostly featuring Biblical narratives designed to teach and inspire. The church architect, Edmund Wilson, wrote of his desire for the first stained glass windows to be “appropriate in feeling” to the design of the building. Although stylistically very different, subsequent windows, echo this sentiment, with the overriding aim of glorifying God. In Walter Camm’s words, “a window should be not only beautiful in its detail, but an inspiration to all beholders for all time.” Beverley Shore Bennett’s consistent approach, in her own words, “has the starting point of prayer and what follows is God given.”</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">If you want to study the windows further – either here in at the church – the following details may be of use to you…</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">East wall windows – the chancel</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">The church architect, Edmund Wilson of Invercargill, in 1920, expressed a dual purpose for the stained glass windows of St. Michael’s. His desire was that they should both be striking works of art and inspire worship. To Arthur Dixon, in June, Wilson wrote of “getting a result worthy of its high purpose in these troublous times.” He further wrote of his desire that the windows should “arrest the attention of the worshippers as they enter the church.”</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">“Lord Bledisloe, a former Governor-General, always maintained that the finest stained glass in New Zealand was in St. Michael’s.” This comment relates specifically to the East window and the St. Michael window, and was made after a visit made in the early 1950s. (This is according to the unknown writer of St. Michael’s Church, a spiral bound, Croxley ‘Li-Flat’ school exercise book in the Alexander Turnbull Library).</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">The Nativity (The Holy Family and the Shepherds) – east wall, the chancel</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">While they were there (Bethlehem), the time came for her to deliver her child. And she gave birth to her first born son and wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a manger because there was no place for them in the inn.

All three windows were designed by Walter Camm and executed by Florence, Robert and Walter Camm, for the firm of Thomas William Camm, The Studio, Smethwick, England. The two sidelights were unveiled on 30 August 1925. The left light was a parting gift from the Reverend Arthur Payne and the right was a gift of the Sunday School children, in memory of those killed in the Great War.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">In the Evening Post, 29 August 1925, an article appears detailing the unveiling of the windows. It carefully describes the portrayal of the subject, including the naturalistic detail of “St. Joseph’s sandals thrown off as he enters the manger.” The article concludes that “the window is remarkable for the richness of its colour and harmony of tones, and as a whole depicts the sacred subject of the Nativity with noble reverence and symbolism full of beautiful meaning.”</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">In correspondence between the Reverend Arthur Payne and Walter Camm, some confusion about the cost was discussed, as the estimate omitted the word ‘each.’ Walter Camm expressed alarm at “the preposterous duty on British stained glass for New Zealand.” Also that “since the war, expenses have increased by leaps and bounds in all directions.” Allowances were made and the two side lights with bronze saddle bars duly arrived on the R.M.S Tainui.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Touch Me Not, Rabboni – north wall, the nave</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Jesus said to her, “Do not hold on to me, because I have not yet ascended to the father.” John 20:17</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">This double pane depicts The Risen Christ and Mary Magdalene, who emerge from a pale gold, decorative background. It was given by Mr and Mrs H.C. Gibbons in memory of their sons, Edward and Walter, killed in the Great War. It was ordered by the Reverend Arthur Payne, at a total cost of two hundred and fifty pounds. (Payne retired in August, 1925.) The letter of authenticity and certification is dated June, 1922. Payne was delighted by “the simple, though beautiful design, without elaborate details or treatment of the subject.”</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">In St. Michael’s Church, however, the writer wonders why the work was carried out by James Powell and Sons, Whitefriars, London, instead of the Camm brothers. He goes on to describe the window as “stereotyped, with commercialised colour”, and Mary’s purple robe as “quite horrible.” He wonders at the appropriateness of the design for two young men killed in action.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Mr Gibbons, donor of the window, visited James Powell and Sons on 15 December 1921. In a letter to Payne, dated 25 September 1922, from Bournemouth, Mr Gibbons expresses his clear delight at the finished windows. “It is difficult for me to express all we feel with regard to the whole of your arrangements, great thoughtfulness and kindnesses in connection with the glorious ceremony of the unveiling of the memorial window to our boys.” The letter is written in a large, flowing script over several backed pages. Mr Gibbons died on 13 March 1941.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">St. Michael in Armour – south wall, the chancel</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">“And war broke out in Heaven; Michael and his angels fought against the dragon.” Revelation 12: 7</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">The St. Michael window occupies the traditional place for the name window. It was unveiled on 2 October 1927. The design chosen was a portion of a window done in memory of the squire of Meriden parish, near Coventry, England – Captain Bankes, who was killed in the retreat from Mons.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">The original drawing was painted by Florence Camm, with the assistance of Robert and Walter Camm. In the draft history of the parish, the subject is described as St Michael “striking down the dragon which symbolises the power of evil.”</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Blessed are the Pure – north wall, the chancel</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">“Blessed are the pure in heart for they will see God.” Matthew 5:8</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">This is the only window in St. Michael’s that does not have a Biblical narrative for its subject. Dedicated in March, 1944, the Flanagan window was erected in memory of their daughter Shirley Isobel, who died in 1939, aged 19.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Walter Camm, who manufactured the window, described its subject as “Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God.” He further related the subject to Shirley in the Madonna lilies representing purity, the spinning wheel, domestic duties and the medallion of harp and scroll to Shirley’s musical tastes and talents.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">St. Raphael – south wall, the chancel</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">“I am one of the seven holy angels, which present the prayers of the saints, and go in before the glory of the Holy One.” Tobit 12:15</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Given by Mrs Evelyn Marsack in memory of her son Nigel and of her parents, Frank and Etta Robins. It was made in 1980, by Paul Hutchins of Miller Studios in Dunedin, and dedicated in 1981. The window depicts St. Raphael, one of the three archangels named in the Jewish scriptures. In the story of Tobit, Raphael uses a fish that is caught to both heal and repel evil.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Symbolically, the fish can also represent the church, the Greek word IXTHUS meaning both ‘fish’ and the words “Jesus Christ son of God Saviour”. Both the shoulder pouch and the medical symbol in the bottom left corner refer to his ministry of healing. St. Raphael steps towards us in swirling garments, characteristic of Beverley Shore Bennett’s style and what she describes as her “swoops and swishes”.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">The Prodigal Son (I am the Good Shepherd) – south wall, the nave</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">“This son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found!” Luke 15:24</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Gifted by Mr and Mrs George Davidson in memory of their parents. The window was dedicated by the Bishop of Wellington, on Jubilee Sunday, 1 October 1967, fifty years after St. Michael’s was declared a parochial district.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">The windows were designed by Mr Pilgrim Wheton and made in Australia. They depict the Prodigal Son and The Good Shepherd. The style is linear, with stylised figures presented with bright clarity. In the two windows beside this, Beverley Shore Bennett consciously followed the same compositional format of a series of frames.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">The Good Samaritan (The True Vine, Love One Another) – south wall, the nave</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">“But a Samaritan while travelling came near him; and when he saw him, he was moved with pity.” Luke 10:33</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">This window was gifted by Mrs Maude Haines in memory of John Frederick Mayo, acting vicar (August 1940-April 1946). It was dedicated by Bishop MacKenzie at the Patronal Festival, 26 September 1971. The window was designed by Beverley Shore Bennett, who arranged for its manufacture by Roy Miller of Miller and Sons, Dunedin. The windows depict the story of The Good Samaritan in four circular frames. Biblical text features throughout the windows, with the new commandment to “love one another” at the top. The windows present both a central truth in Christ’s teaching as well as a tribute to the life and work of Mayo.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">The Parable of the Sower (Secrets of the Kingdom of God, The Mustard Seed) – south wall, the nave</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">“But as for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit.” Matthew 13:23</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Installed in 1981, this window is in memory of Dorothy Cowell Hentry and was paid for out of her generous legacy. This window depicts the parable of the sower and what that parable reveals about the Kingdom of Heaven. Biblical text is interspersed between the frames. It echoes the simple design of The Prodigal Son in its storybook format. The windows were designed by Beverley Shore Bennett and made by Paul Hutchins of Miller Studios, Dunedin.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">The Crucifixion (Truly this was the Son of God) – north wall, the nave</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Now when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that in this way he breathed his last, he said, “Truly this man was God’s son!” Mark 15:39</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">This window depicts the crucified Christ on a dramatic red background. The contrasting left panel is predominantly rich blues, focussed in Mary’s garment. The window is in memory of Maude Haines who died on the 29 September 1971, her bequest covering most of the cost of the narthex. The vestry decided to place another window in St. Michael’s, “a project dear to the heart of Mrs Haines.” The window was installed and consecrated in 1975/6.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">The coloured drawing (watercolour) for the Crucifixion windows, designed by Beverley Shore Bennett, is in the Alexander Turnbull Library. Characteristically, the lead is clearly a part of the design and relates to the subject for effect, rather than functioning independently. As a result, both sides are connected and flow into each other. The windows were made by Roy Miller of Miller Studios, Dunedin. Roy Miller retired in 1981.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">The Transfiguration (Jesus Appears, The Disciples) – north wall, the nave</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">“Jesus took with him Peter and James and his brother John and led them up a high mountain by themselves. And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became dazzling white.” Matthew 17:1-2</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">The window is dedicated to Max Willacy-Kuhn (11 September 1904 – 24 February 1975). It was designed by Beverley Shore Bennett and installed towards the end of 1977 by his widow and family. Mrs Elizabeth Wallacy-Kuhn described the subject of the Transfiguration as “a powerful symbol of the emergent, immaculate Christ”. Personal detail is also reflected in the choice of the predominant blue, Mr Willacy-Kuhn’s favourite colour, in contrast with the “homespun brown colours of the kneeling disciples”, so bringing heaven and earth together.</div>\n<p>In 2006 St. Michael’s celebrated 100years since the old church hall was built on site.

The styles vary from the Camm Brothers’ diagonally latticed, detailed compositions to the moments in movement that characterize Beverley Shore Bennett’s work. Some other New Zealand examples of the work of the Camm Brothers of Smethwick feature in Fiona Ciaran’s book The Stained Glass Windows of Canterbury. Beverley Shore Bennett is the only New Zealand woman to have been made a fellow of the British Society of Master Glass Painters. She was awarded an MBE in June, 1980. She has completed over five hundred stained glass window designs throughout New Zealand.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>These stained glass windows are a testament to individuals and communities associated with St. Michael’s Church over almost a century. They are gifts, memorials and heritage works, mostly featuring Biblical narratives designed to teach and inspire. The church architect, Edmund Wilson, wrote of his desire for the first stained glass windows to be “appropriate in feeling” to the design of the building. Although stylistically very different, subsequent windows, echo this sentiment, with the overriding aim of glorifying God. In Walter Camm’s words, “a window should be not only beautiful in its detail, but an inspiration to all beholders for all time.” Beverley Shore Bennett’s consistent approach, in her own words, “has the starting point of prayer and what follows is God given.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you want to study the windows further – either here in at the church – the following details may be of use to you…</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>East wall windows – the chancel</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The church architect, Edmund Wilson of Invercargill, in 1920, expressed a dual purpose for the stained glass windows of St. Michael’s. His desire was that they should both be striking works of art and inspire worship. To Arthur Dixon, in June, Wilson wrote of “getting a result worthy of its high purpose in these troublous times.” He further wrote of his desire that the windows should “arrest the attention of the worshippers as they enter the church.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Lord Bledisloe, a former Governor-General, always maintained that the finest stained glass in New Zealand was in St. Michael’s.” This comment relates specifically to the East window and the St. Michael window, and was made after a visit made in the early 1950s. (This is according to the unknown writer of St. Michael’s Church, a spiral bound, Croxley ‘Li-Flat’ school exercise book in the Alexander Turnbull Library).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Nativity (The Holy Family and the Shepherds) – east wall, the chancel</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>While they were there (Bethlehem), the time came for her to deliver her child.

Luke 2: 6-7</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The central light, unveiled in 1921, was given by Mrs Edward Anderson, in memory of her husband who died in 1919. All three windows were designed by Walter Camm and executed by Florence, Robert and Walter Camm, for the firm of Thomas William Camm, The Studio, Smethwick, England. The two sidelights were unveiled on 30 August 1925. The left light was a parting gift from the Reverend Arthur Payne and the right was a gift of the Sunday School children, in memory of those killed in the Great War.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In the Evening Post, 29 August 1925, an article appears detailing the unveiling of the windows. It carefully describes the portrayal of the subject, including the naturalistic detail of “St. Joseph’s sandals thrown off as he enters the manger.” The article concludes that “the window is remarkable for the richness of its colour and harmony of tones, and as a whole depicts the sacred subject of the Nativity with noble reverence and symbolism full of beautiful meaning.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In correspondence between the Reverend Arthur Payne and Walter Camm, some confusion about the cost was discussed, as the estimate omitted the word ‘each.’ Walter Camm expressed alarm at “the preposterous duty on British stained glass for New Zealand.” Also that “since the war, expenses have increased by leaps and bounds in all directions.” Allowances were made and the two side lights with bronze saddle bars duly arrived on the R.M.S Tainui.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Touch Me Not, Rabboni – north wall, the nave</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Jesus said to her, “Do not hold on to me, because I have not yet ascended to the father.” John 20:17</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This double pane depicts The Risen Christ and Mary Magdalene, who emerge from a pale gold, decorative background. It was given by Mr and Mrs H.C. Gibbons in memory of their sons, Edward and Walter, killed in the Great War. It was ordered by the Reverend Arthur Payne, at a total cost of two hundred and fifty pounds. (Payne retired in August, 1925.) The letter of authenticity and certification is dated June, 1922. Payne was delighted by “the simple, though beautiful design, without elaborate details or treatment of the subject.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In St. Michael’s Church, however, the writer wonders why the work was carried out by James Powell and Sons, Whitefriars, London, instead of the Camm brothers. He goes on to describe the window as “stereotyped, with commercialised colour”, and Mary’s purple robe as “quite horrible.” He wonders at the appropriateness of the design for two young men killed in action.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Mr Gibbons, donor of the window, visited James Powell and Sons on 15 December 1921. In a letter to Payne, dated 25 September 1922, from Bournemouth, Mr Gibbons expresses his clear delight at the finished windows. “It is difficult for me to express all we feel with regard to the whole of your arrangements, great thoughtfulness and kindnesses in connection with the glorious ceremony of the unveiling of the memorial window to our boys.” The letter is written in a large, flowing script over several backed pages. Mr Gibbons died on 13 March 1941.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>St. Michael in Armour – south wall, the chancel</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“And war broke out in Heaven; Michael and his angels fought against the dragon.” Revelation 12: 7</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The St. Michael window occupies the traditional place for the name window. It was unveiled on 2 October 1927. The design chosen was a portion of a window done in memory of the squire of Meriden parish, near Coventry, England – Captain Bankes, who was killed in the retreat from Mons.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The original drawing was painted by Florence Camm, with the assistance of Robert and Walter Camm. In the draft history of the parish, the subject is described as St Michael “striking down the dragon which symbolises the power of evil.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Blessed are the Pure – north wall, the chancel</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Blessed are the pure in heart for they will see God.” Matthew 5:8</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This is the only window in St. Michael’s that does not have a Biblical narrative for its subject. Dedicated in March, 1944, the Flanagan window was erected in memory of their daughter Shirley Isobel, who died in 1939, aged 19.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Walter Camm, who manufactured the window, described its subject as “Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God.” He further related the subject to Shirley in the Madonna lilies representing purity, the spinning wheel, domestic duties and the medallion of harp and scroll to Shirley’s musical tastes and talents.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>St. Raphael – south wall, the chancel</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“I am one of the seven holy angels, which present the prayers of the saints, and go in before the glory of the Holy One.” Tobit 12:15</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Given by Mrs Evelyn Marsack in memory of her son Nigel and of her parents, Frank and Etta Robins. It was made in 1980, by Paul Hutchins of Miller Studios in Dunedin, and dedicated in 1981. The window depicts St. Raphael, one of the three archangels named in the Jewish scriptures. In the story of Tobit, Raphael uses a fish that is caught to both heal and repel evil.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Symbolically, the fish can also represent the church, the Greek word IXTHUS meaning both ‘fish’ and the words “Jesus Christ son of God Saviour”. Both the shoulder pouch and the medical symbol in the bottom left corner refer to his ministry of healing. St. Raphael steps towards us in swirling garments, characteristic of Beverley Shore Bennett’s style and what she describes as her “swoops and swishes”.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Prodigal Son (I am the Good Shepherd) – south wall, the nave</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“This son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found!” Luke 15:24</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Gifted by Mr and Mrs George Davidson in memory of their parents. The window was dedicated by the Bishop of Wellington, on Jubilee Sunday, 1 October 1967, fifty years after St. Michael’s was declared a parochial district.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The windows were designed by Mr Pilgrim Wheton and made in Australia. They depict the Prodigal Son and The Good Shepherd. The style is linear, with stylised figures presented with bright clarity. In the two windows beside this, Beverley Shore Bennett consciously followed the same compositional format of a series of frames.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Good Samaritan (The True Vine, Love One Another) – south wall, the nave</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“But a Samaritan while travelling came near him; and when he saw him, he was moved with pity.” Luke 10:33</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This window was gifted by Mrs Maude Haines in memory of John Frederick Mayo, acting vicar (August 1940-April 1946). It was dedicated by Bishop MacKenzie at the Patronal Festival, 26 September 1971. The window was designed by Beverley Shore Bennett, who arranged for its manufacture by Roy Miller of Miller and Sons, Dunedin. The windows depict the story of The Good Samaritan in four circular frames. Biblical text features throughout the windows, with the new commandment to “love one another” at the top. The windows present both a central truth in Christ’s teaching as well as a tribute to the life and work of Mayo.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Parable of the Sower (Secrets of the Kingdom of God, The Mustard Seed) – south wall, the nave</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“But as for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit.” Matthew 13:23</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Installed in 1981, this window is in memory of Dorothy Cowell Hentry and was paid for out of her generous legacy. This window depicts the parable of the sower and what that parable reveals about the Kingdom of Heaven. Biblical text is interspersed between the frames. It echoes the simple design of The Prodigal Son in its storybook format. The windows were designed by Beverley Shore Bennett and made by Paul Hutchins of Miller Studios, Dunedin.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Crucifixion (Truly this was the Son of God) – north wall, the nave</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Now when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that in this way he breathed his last, he said, “Truly this man was God’s son!” Mark 15:39</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This window depicts the crucified Christ on a dramatic red background. The contrasting left panel is predominantly rich blues, focussed in Mary’s garment. The window is in memory of Maude Haines who died on the 29 September 1971, her bequest covering most of the cost of the narthex. The vestry decided to place another window in St. Michael’s, “a project dear to the heart of Mrs Haines.” The window was installed and consecrated in 1975/6.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The coloured drawing (watercolour) for the Crucifixion windows, designed by Beverley Shore Bennett, is in the Alexander Turnbull Library. Characteristically, the lead is clearly a part of the design and relates to the subject for effect, rather than functioning independently. As a result, both sides are connected and flow into each other. The windows were made by Roy Miller of Miller Studios, Dunedin. Roy Miller retired in 1981.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Transfiguration (Jesus Appears, The Disciples) – north wall, the nave</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Jesus took with him Peter and James and his brother John and led them up a high mountain by themselves. And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became dazzling white.” Matthew 17:1-2</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The window is dedicated to Max Willacy-Kuhn (11 September 1904 – 24 February 1975). It was designed by Beverley Shore Bennett and installed towards the end of 1977 by his widow and family. Mrs Elizabeth Wallacy-Kuhn described the subject of the Transfiguration as “a powerful symbol of the emergent, immaculate Christ”. Personal detail is also reflected in the choice of the predominant blue, Mr Willacy-Kuhn’s favourite colour, in contrast with the “homespun brown colours of the kneeling disciples”, so bringing heaven and earth together.</p>\n', 'History', NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, 1, NULL, 0, 1, 0, 0, 'Saved (new)', NULL, 'Inherit', 'Inherit', NULL, 29),

Dedicated in March, 1944, the Flanagan window was erected in memory of their daughter Shirley Isobel, who died in 1939, aged 19.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Walter Camm, who manufactured the window, described its subject as “Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God.” He further related the subject to Shirley in the Madonna lilies representing purity, the spinning wheel, domestic duties and the medallion of harp and scroll to Shirley’s musical tastes and talents.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">St. Raphael – south wall, the chancel</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">“I am one of the seven holy angels, which present the prayers of the saints, and go in before the glory of the Holy One.” Tobit 12:15</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Given by Mrs Evelyn Marsack in memory of her son Nigel and of her parents, Frank and Etta Robins. It was made in 1980, by Paul Hutchins of Miller Studios in Dunedin, and dedicated in 1981. The window depicts St. Raphael, one of the three archangels named in the Jewish scriptures. In the story of Tobit, Raphael uses a fish that is caught to both heal and repel evil.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Symbolically, the fish can also represent the church, the Greek word IXTHUS meaning both ‘fish’ and the words “Jesus Christ son of God Saviour”. Both the shoulder pouch and the medical symbol in the bottom left corner refer to his ministry of healing. St. Raphael steps towards us in swirling garments, characteristic of Beverley Shore Bennett’s style and what she describes as her “swoops and swishes”.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">The Prodigal Son (I am the Good Shepherd) – south wall, the nave</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">“This son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found!” Luke 15:24</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Gifted by Mr and Mrs George Davidson in memory of their parents.

They depict the Prodigal Son and The Good Shepherd. The style is linear, with stylised figures presented with bright clarity. In the two windows beside this, Beverley Shore Bennett consciously followed the same compositional format of a series of frames.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">The Good Samaritan (The True Vine, Love One Another) – south wall, the nave</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">“But a Samaritan while travelling came near him; and when he saw him, he was moved with pity.” Luke 10:33</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">This window was gifted by Mrs Maude Haines in memory of John Frederick Mayo, acting vicar (August 1940-April 1946). It was dedicated by Bishop MacKenzie at the Patronal Festival, 26 September 1971. The window was designed by Beverley Shore Bennett, who arranged for its manufacture by Roy Miller of Miller and Sons, Dunedin. The windows depict the story of The Good Samaritan in four circular frames. Biblical text features throughout the windows, with the new commandment to “love one another” at the top. The windows present both a central truth in Christ’s teaching as well as a tribute to the life and work of Mayo.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">The Parable of the Sower (Secrets of the Kingdom of God, The Mustard Seed) – south wall, the nave</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">“But as for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit.” Matthew 13:23</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Installed in 1981, this window is in memory of Dorothy Cowell Hentry and was paid for out of her generous legacy. This window depicts the parable of the sower and what that parable reveals about the Kingdom of Heaven. Biblical text is interspersed between the frames. It echoes the simple design of The Prodigal Son in its storybook format.

The contrasting left panel is predominantly rich blues, focussed in Mary’s garment. The window is in memory of Maude Haines who died on the 29 September 1971, her bequest covering most of the cost of the narthex. The vestry decided to place another window in St. Michael’s, “a project dear to the heart of Mrs Haines.” The window was installed and consecrated in 1975/6.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">The coloured drawing (watercolour) for the Crucifixion windows, designed by Beverley Shore Bennett, is in the Alexander Turnbull Library. Characteristically, the lead is clearly a part of the design and relates to the subject for effect, rather than functioning independently. As a result, both sides are connected and flow into each other. The windows were made by Roy Miller of Miller Studios, Dunedin.

It was designed by Beverley Shore Bennett and installed towards the end of 1977 by his widow and family. Mrs Elizabeth Wallacy-Kuhn described the subject of the Transfiguration as “a powerful symbol of the emergent, immaculate Christ”. Personal detail is also reflected in the choice of the predominant blue, Mr Willacy-Kuhn’s favourite colour, in contrast with the “homespun brown colours of the kneeling disciples”, so bringing heaven and earth together.</div>\n<p>In 2006 St. Michael’s celebrated 100years since the old church hall was built on site. Building of the church started in 1912 and the foundation stone was laid in 1919. This stone is a block of marble inscribed with a Maltese Cross and the year given in Roman numerals, MCMXIX and can be found at the east end of the church on St Michael’s Crescent. This event is recorded in the National Library archives of the Evening Post.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In 1940 a strong earthquake irrecoverably damaged the nave (main section of the church where the pews are). Despite war time austerity that part of the church was rebuilt by 1942. Further strengthening of the brick work wasn’t carried out until 2002!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Banners</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The four fabric banners hanging over the nave of St Michael’s were designed and made by Bridget Chapman, who was a parishioner, and installed during the late 1980’s. They speak of the great biblical themes of creation, redemption and the coming of the Spirit. The larger work hanging on the west wall above the entrance to the nave, was designed and executed by Beverley Shore Bennett, who also designed several of the stained glass windows in our church (see more below on Beverly).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You can read about the dedication by Mrs Anne Davidson of this wall-hanging as a memorial to her husband George Davidson on page 112 (and some historically relevant comment on page 94) of Joan Wood’s book St Michael and All Angels, Kelburn Copies of which you can find in the narthex (foyer). Feel free to keep one. In the book, the work is also referred to as a “tapestry” on pages 112 and 116, though the usual description was “wall-hanging”.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In 1968 Beverley Shore Bennet also designed and executed the Bible Class banner of St. Michael that stands on a wooden support in the chancel of our church. This replaces an earlier one by her of one that was stolen in 1967 but retains the style of the original.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Windows</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The stained glass windows in St. Michael’s range in date from 1921 to the early 1980s. The ten windows fall loosely into two groups: those of English origin installed during the foundation of the church in the 1920s and those designed and made mainly in New Zealand, installed from the late 1960s to the early 1980s, with the remaining window installed in the 1940s. The styles vary from the Camm Brothers’ diagonally latticed, detailed compositions to the moments in movement that characterize Beverley Shore Bennett’s work. Some other New Zealand examples of the work of the Camm Brothers of Smethwick feature in Fiona Ciaran’s book The Stained Glass Windows of Canterbury. Beverley Shore Bennett is the only New Zealand woman to have been made a fellow of the British Society of Master Glass Painters. She was awarded an MBE in June, 1980. She has completed over five hundred stained glass window designs throughout New Zealand.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>These stained glass windows are a testament to individuals and communities associated with St. Michael’s Church over almost a century. They are gifts, memorials and heritage works, mostly featuring Biblical narratives designed to teach and inspire. The church architect, Edmund Wilson, wrote of his desire for the first stained glass windows to be “appropriate in feeling” to the design of the building. Although stylistically very different, subsequent windows, echo this sentiment, with the overriding aim of glorifying God. In Walter Camm’s words, “a window should be not only beautiful in its detail, but an inspiration to all beholders for all time.” Beverley Shore Bennett’s consistent approach, in her own words, “has the starting point of prayer and what follows is God given.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you want to study the windows further – either here in at the church – the following details may be of use to you…</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>East wall windows – the chancel</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The church architect, Edmund Wilson of Invercargill, in 1920, expressed a dual purpose for the stained glass windows of St. Michael’s. His desire was that they should both be striking works of art and inspire worship. To Arthur Dixon, in June, Wilson wrote of “getting a result worthy of its high purpose in these troublous times.” He further wrote of his desire that the windows should “arrest the attention of the worshippers as they enter the church.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Lord Bledisloe, a former Governor-General, always maintained that the finest stained glass in New Zealand was in St. Michael’s.” This comment relates specifically to the East window and the St. Michael window, and was made after a visit made in the early 1950s. (This is according to the unknown writer of St. Michael’s Church, a spiral bound, Croxley ‘Li-Flat’ school exercise book in the Alexander Turnbull Library).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Nativity (The Holy Family and the Shepherds) – east wall, the chancel</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>While they were there (Bethlehem), the time came for her to deliver her child. And she gave birth to her first born son and wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a manger because there was no place for them in the inn. Luke 2: 6-7</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The central light, unveiled in 1921, was given by Mrs Edward Anderson, in memory of her husband who died in 1919. All three windows were designed by Walter Camm and executed by Florence, Robert and Walter Camm, for the firm of Thomas William Camm, The Studio, Smethwick, England. The two sidelights were unveiled on 30 August 1925. The left light was a parting gift from the Reverend Arthur Payne and the right was a gift of the Sunday School children, in memory of those killed in the Great War.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In the Evening Post, 29 August 1925, an article appears detailing the unveiling of the windows. It carefully describes the portrayal of the subject, including the naturalistic detail of “St. Joseph’s sandals thrown off as he enters the manger.” The article concludes that “the window is remarkable for the richness of its colour and harmony of tones, and as a whole depicts the sacred subject of the Nativity with noble reverence and symbolism full of beautiful meaning.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In correspondence between the Reverend Arthur Payne and Walter Camm, some confusion about the cost was discussed, as the estimate omitted the word ‘each.’ Walter Camm expressed alarm at “the preposterous duty on British stained glass for New Zealand.” Also that “since the war, expenses have increased by leaps and bounds in all directions.” Allowances were made and the two side lights with bronze saddle bars duly arrived on the R.M.S Tainui.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Touch Me Not, Rabboni – north wall, the nave</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Jesus said to her, “Do not hold on to me, because I have not yet ascended to the father.” John 20:17</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This double pane depicts The Risen Christ and Mary Magdalene, who emerge from a pale gold, decorative background. It was given by Mr and Mrs H.C. Gibbons in memory of their sons, Edward and Walter, killed in the Great War. It was ordered by the Reverend Arthur Payne, at a total cost of two hundred and fifty pounds. (Payne retired in August, 1925.) The letter of authenticity and certification is dated June, 1922. Payne was delighted by “the simple, though beautiful design, without elaborate details or treatment of the subject.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In St. Michael’s Church, however, the writer wonders why the work was carried out by James Powell and Sons, Whitefriars, London, instead of the Camm brothers. He goes on to describe the window as “stereotyped, with commercialised colour”, and Mary’s purple robe as “quite horrible.” He wonders at the appropriateness of the design for two young men killed in action.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Mr Gibbons, donor of the window, visited James Powell and Sons on 15 December 1921. In a letter to Payne, dated 25 September 1922, from Bournemouth, Mr Gibbons expresses his clear delight at the finished windows. “It is difficult for me to express all we feel with regard to the whole of your arrangements, great thoughtfulness and kindnesses in connection with the glorious ceremony of the unveiling of the memorial window to our boys.” The letter is written in a large, flowing script over several backed pages. Mr Gibbons died on 13 March 1941.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>St. Michael in Armour – south wall, the chancel</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“And war broke out in Heaven; Michael and his angels fought against the dragon.” Revelation 12: 7</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The St. Michael window occupies the traditional place for the name window.

The ten windows fall loosely into two groups: those of English origin installed during the foundation of the church in the 1920s and those designed and made mainly in New Zealand, installed from the late 1960s to the early 1980s, with the remaining window installed in the 1940s. The styles vary from the Camm Brothers’ diagonally latticed, detailed compositions to the moments in movement that characterize Beverley Shore Bennett’s work. Some other New Zealand examples of the work of the Camm Brothers of Smethwick feature in Fiona Ciaran’s book The Stained Glass Windows of Canterbury. Beverley Shore Bennett is the only New Zealand woman to have been made a fellow of the British Society of Master Glass Painters. She was awarded an MBE in June, 1980. She has completed over five hundred stained glass window designs throughout New Zealand.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">These stained glass windows are a testament to individuals and communities associated with St. Michael’s Church over almost a century. They are gifts, memorials and heritage works, mostly featuring Biblical narratives designed to teach and inspire. The church architect, Edmund Wilson, wrote of his desire for the first stained glass windows to be “appropriate in feeling” to the design of the building. Although stylistically very different, subsequent windows, echo this sentiment, with the overriding aim of glorifying God. In Walter Camm’s words, “a window should be not only beautiful in its detail, but an inspiration to all beholders for all time.” Beverley Shore Bennett’s consistent approach, in her own words, “has the starting point of prayer and what follows is God given.”</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">If you want to study the windows further – either here in at the church – the following details may be of use to you…</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">East wall windows – the chancel</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">The church architect, Edmund Wilson of Invercargill, in 1920, expressed a dual purpose for the stained glass windows of St. Michael’s. His desire was that they should both be striking works of art and inspire worship. To Arthur Dixon, in June, Wilson wrote of “getting a result worthy of its high purpose in these troublous times.” He further wrote of his desire that the windows should “arrest the attention of the worshippers as they enter the church.”</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">“Lord Bledisloe, a former Governor-General, always maintained that the finest stained glass in New Zealand was in St. Michael’s.” This comment relates specifically to the East window and the St. Michael window, and was made after a visit made in the early 1950s.

All three windows were designed by Walter Camm and executed by Florence, Robert and Walter Camm, for the firm of Thomas William Camm, The Studio, Smethwick, England. The two sidelights were unveiled on 30 August 1925.

It carefully describes the portrayal of the subject, including the naturalistic detail of “St. Joseph’s sandals thrown off as he enters the manger.” The article concludes that “the window is remarkable for the richness of its colour and harmony of tones, and as a whole depicts the sacred subject of the Nativity with noble reverence and symbolism full of beautiful meaning.”</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">In correspondence between the Reverend Arthur Payne and Walter Camm, some confusion about the cost was discussed, as the estimate omitted the word ‘each.’ Walter Camm expressed alarm at “the preposterous duty on British stained glass for New Zealand.” Also that “since the war, expenses have increased by leaps and bounds in all directions.” Allowances were made and the two side lights with bronze saddle bars duly arrived on the R.M.S Tainui.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Touch Me Not, Rabboni – north wall, the nave</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Jesus said to her, “Do not hold on to me, because I have not yet ascended to the father.” John 20:17</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">This double pane depicts The Risen Christ and Mary Magdalene, who emerge from a pale gold, decorative background.

In a letter to Payne, dated 25 September 1922, from Bournemouth, Mr Gibbons expresses his clear delight at the finished windows. “It is difficult for me to express all we feel with regard to the whole of your arrangements, great thoughtfulness and kindnesses in connection with the glorious ceremony of the unveiling of the memorial window to our boys.” The letter is written in a large, flowing script over several backed pages.

It was unveiled on 2 October 1927. The design chosen was a portion of a window done in memory of the squire of Meriden parish, near Coventry, England – Captain Bankes, who was killed in the retreat from Mons.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">The original drawing was painted by Florence Camm, with the assistance of Robert and Walter Camm.

Dedicated in March, 1944, the Flanagan window was erected in memory of their daughter Shirley Isobel, who died in 1939, aged 19.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Walter Camm, who manufactured the window, described its subject as “Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God.” He further related the subject to Shirley in the Madonna lilies representing purity, the spinning wheel, domestic duties and the medallion of harp and scroll to Shirley’s musical tastes and talents.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">St. Raphael – south wall, the chancel</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">“I am one of the seven holy angels, which present the prayers of the saints, and go in before the glory of the Holy One.” Tobit 12:15</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Given by Mrs Evelyn Marsack in memory of her son Nigel and of her parents, Frank and Etta Robins. It was made in 1980, by Paul Hutchins of Miller Studios in Dunedin, and dedicated in 1981. The window depicts St. Raphael, one of the three archangels named in the Jewish scriptures. In the story of Tobit, Raphael uses a fish that is caught to both heal and repel evil.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Symbolically, the fish can also represent the church, the Greek word IXTHUS meaning both ‘fish’ and the words “Jesus Christ son of God Saviour”. Both the shoulder pouch and the medical symbol in the bottom left corner refer to his ministry of healing. St. Raphael steps towards us in swirling garments, characteristic of Beverley Shore Bennett’s style and what she describes as her “swoops and swishes”.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">The Prodigal Son (I am the Good Shepherd) – south wall, the nave</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">“This son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found!” Luke 15:24</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Gifted by Mr and Mrs George Davidson in memory of their parents. The window was dedicated by the Bishop of Wellington, on Jubilee Sunday, 1 October 1967, fifty years after St. Michael’s was declared a parochial district.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">The windows were designed by Mr Pilgrim Wheton and made in Australia. They depict the Prodigal Son and The Good Shepherd. The style is linear, with stylised figures presented with bright clarity. In the two windows beside this, Beverley Shore Bennett consciously followed the same compositional format of a series of frames.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">The Good Samaritan (The True Vine, Love One Another) – south wall, the nave</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">“But a Samaritan while travelling came near him; and when he saw him, he was moved with pity.” Luke 10:33</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">This window was gifted by Mrs Maude Haines in memory of John Frederick Mayo, acting vicar (August 1940-April 1946). It was dedicated by Bishop MacKenzie at the Patronal Festival, 26 September 1971. The window was designed by Beverley Shore Bennett, who arranged for its manufacture by Roy Miller of Miller and Sons, Dunedin. The windows depict the story of The Good Samaritan in four circular frames. Biblical text features throughout the windows, with the new commandment to “love one another” at the top. The windows present both a central truth in Christ’s teaching as well as a tribute to the life and work of Mayo.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">The Parable of the Sower (Secrets of the Kingdom of God, The Mustard Seed) – south wall, the nave</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">“But as for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit.” Matthew 13:23</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Installed in 1981, this window is in memory of Dorothy Cowell Hentry and was paid for out of her generous legacy. This window depicts the parable of the sower and what that parable reveals about the Kingdom of Heaven. Biblical text is interspersed between the frames. It echoes the simple design of The Prodigal Son in its storybook format. The windows were designed by Beverley Shore Bennett and made by Paul Hutchins of Miller Studios, Dunedin.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">The Crucifixion (Truly this was the Son of God) – north wall, the nave</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Now when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that in this way he breathed his last, he said, “Truly this man was God’s son!” Mark 15:39</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">This window depicts the crucified Christ on a dramatic red background. The contrasting left panel is predominantly rich blues, focussed in Mary’s garment. The window is in memory of Maude Haines who died on the 29 September 1971, her bequest covering most of the cost of the narthex. The vestry decided to place another window in St. Michael’s, “a project dear to the heart of Mrs Haines.” The window was installed and consecrated in 1975/6.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">The coloured drawing (watercolour) for the Crucifixion windows, designed by Beverley Shore Bennett, is in the Alexander Turnbull Library. Characteristically, the lead is clearly a part of the design and relates to the subject for effect, rather than functioning independently. As a result, both sides are connected and flow into each other. The windows were made by Roy Miller of Miller Studios, Dunedin. Roy Miller retired in 1981.</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">The Transfiguration (Jesus Appears, The Disciples) – north wall, the nave</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">“Jesus took with him Peter and James and his brother John and led them up a high mountain by themselves. And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became dazzling white.” Matthew 17:1-2</div>\n<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">The window is dedicated to Max Willacy-Kuhn (11 September 1904 – 24 February 1975). It was designed by Beverley Shore Bennett and installed towards the end of 1977 by his widow and family. Mrs Elizabeth Wallacy-Kuhn described the subject of the Transfiguration as “a powerful symbol of the emergent, immaculate Christ”. Personal detail is also reflected in the choice of the predominant blue, Mr Willacy-Kuhn’s favourite colour, in contrast with the “homespun brown colours of the kneeling disciples”, so bringing heaven and earth together.</div>\n<p>In 2006 St. Michael’s celebrated 100years since the old church hall was built on site. Building of the church started in 1912 and the foundation stone was laid in 1919. This stone is a block of marble inscribed with a Maltese Cross and the year given in Roman numerals, MCMXIX and can be found at the east end of the church on St Michael’s Crescent. This event is recorded in the National Library archives of the Evening Post.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In 1940 a strong earthquake irrecoverably damaged the nave (main section of the church where the pews are). Despite war time austerity that part of the church was rebuilt by 1942.

They speak of the great biblical themes of creation, redemption and the coming of the Spirit. The larger work hanging on the west wall above the entrance to the nave, was designed and executed by Beverley Shore Bennett, who also designed several of the stained glass windows in our church (see more below on Beverly).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You can read about the dedication by Mrs Anne Davidson of this wall-hanging as a memorial to her husband George Davidson on page 112 (and some historically relevant comment on page 94) of Joan Wood’s book St Michael and All Angels, Kelburn Copies of which you can find in the narthex (foyer).

It was unveiled on 2 October 1927. The design chosen was a portion of a window done in memory of the squire of Meriden parish, near Coventry, England – Captain Bankes, who was killed in the retreat from Mons.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The original drawing was painted by Florence Camm, with the assistance of Robert and Walter Camm. In the draft history of the parish, the subject is described as St Michael “striking down the dragon which symbolises the power of evil.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Blessed are the Pure – north wall, the chancel</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Blessed are the pure in heart for they will see God.” Matthew 5:8</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This is the only window in St. Michael’s that does not have a Biblical narrative for its subject. Dedicated in March, 1944, the Flanagan window was erected in memory of their daughter Shirley Isobel, who died in 1939, aged 19.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Walter Camm, who manufactured the window, described its subject as “Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God.” He further related the subject to Shirley in the Madonna lilies representing purity, the spinning wheel, domestic duties and the medallion of harp and scroll to Shirley’s musical tastes and talents.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>St. Raphael – south wall, the chancel</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“I am one of the seven holy angels, which present the prayers of the saints, and go in before the glory of the Holy One.” Tobit 12:15</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Given by Mrs Evelyn Marsack in memory of her son Nigel and of her parents, Frank and Etta Robins. It was made in 1980, by Paul Hutchins of Miller Studios in Dunedin, and dedicated in 1981. The window depicts St. Raphael, one of the three archangels named in the Jewish scriptures. In the story of Tobit, Raphael uses a fish that is caught to both heal and repel evil.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Symbolically, the fish can also represent the church, the Greek word IXTHUS meaning both ‘fish’ and the words “Jesus Christ son of God Saviour”. Both the shoulder pouch and the medical symbol in the bottom left corner refer to his ministry of healing. St. Raphael steps towards us in swirling garments, characteristic of Beverley Shore Bennett’s style and what she describes as her “swoops and swishes”.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Prodigal Son (I am the Good Shepherd) – south wall, the nave</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“This son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found!” Luke 15:24</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Gifted by Mr and Mrs George Davidson in memory of their parents.

They depict the Prodigal Son and The Good Shepherd. The style is linear, with stylised figures presented with bright clarity.

It was dedicated by Bishop MacKenzie at the Patronal Festival, 26 September 1971. The window was designed by Beverley Shore Bennett, who arranged for its manufacture by Roy Miller of Miller and Sons, Dunedin. The windows depict the story of The Good Samaritan in four circular frames. Biblical text features throughout the windows, with the new commandment to “love one another” at the top. The windows present both a central truth in Christ’s teaching as well as a tribute to the life and work of Mayo.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Parable of the Sower (Secrets of the Kingdom of God, The Mustard Seed) – south wall, the nave</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“But as for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit.” Matthew 13:23</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Installed in 1981, this window is in memory of Dorothy Cowell Hentry and was paid for out of her generous legacy. This window depicts the parable of the sower and what that parable reveals about the Kingdom of Heaven. Biblical text is interspersed between the frames. It echoes the simple design of The Prodigal Son in its storybook format. The windows were designed by Beverley Shore Bennett and made by Paul Hutchins of Miller Studios, Dunedin.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Crucifixion (Truly this was the Son of God) – north wall, the nave</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Now when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that in this way he breathed his last, he said, “Truly this man was God’s son!” Mark 15:39</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This window depicts the crucified Christ on a dramatic red background. The contrasting left panel is predominantly rich blues, focussed in Mary’s garment. The window is in memory of Maude Haines who died on the 29 September 1971, her bequest covering most of the cost of the narthex. The vestry decided to place another window in St. Michael’s, “a project dear to the heart of Mrs Haines.” The window was installed and consecrated in 1975/6.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The coloured drawing (watercolour) for the Crucifixion windows, designed by Beverley Shore Bennett, is in the Alexander Turnbull Library. Characteristically, the lead is clearly a part of the design and relates to the subject for effect, rather than functioning independently. As a result, both sides are connected and flow into each other. The windows were made by Roy Miller of Miller Studios, Dunedin. Roy Miller retired in 1981.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The Transfiguration (Jesus Appears, The Disciples) – north wall, the nave</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>“Jesus took with him Peter and James and his brother John and led them up a high mountain by themselves. And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became dazzling white.” Matthew 17:1-2</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The window is dedicated to Max Willacy-Kuhn (11 September 1904 – 24 February 1975). It was designed by Beverley Shore Bennett and installed towards the end of 1977 by his widow and family. Mrs Elizabeth Wallacy-Kuhn described the subject of the Transfiguration as “a powerful symbol of the emergent, immaculate Christ”. Personal detail is also reflected in the choice of the predominant blue, Mr Willacy-Kuhn’s favourite colour, in contrast with the “homespun brown colours of the kneeling disciples”, so bringing heaven and earth together.</p>', 'History', NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, 1, NULL, 0, 1, 0, 0, 'Published', NULL, 'Inherit', 'Inherit', NULL, 29);

Building of the church started in 1912 and the foundation       stone was laid in 1919. This stone is a block of marble inscribed with a       Maltese Cross and the year given in Roman numerals, MCMXIX and can be found       at the east end of the church on St Michael’s Crescent. This event is       recorded in the National Library archives of the Evening Post.</p>\n<p>In 1940 a strong earthquake irrecoverably damaged the nave (main section of       the church where the pews are). Despite war time austerity that part of the       church was rebuilt by 1942. Further strengthening of the brick work wasn’t       carried out until 2002!</p>\n<h4>Banners</h4>\n<p>The four fabric banners hanging over the nave of St Michael’s were designed       and made by Bridget Chapman, who was a parishioner, and installed during the       late 1980’s. They speak of the great biblical themes of creation, redemption       and the coming of the Spirit. The larger work hanging on the west wall above       the entrance to the nave, was designed and executed by Beverley Shore       Bennett, who also designed several of the stained glass windows in our       church (see more below on Beverly).</p>\n<p>You can read about the dedication by Mrs Anne Davidson of this wall-hanging       as a memorial to her husband George Davidson on page 112 (and some       historically relevant comment on page 94) of Joan Wood’s book St Michael and       All Angels, Kelburn Copies of which you can find in the narthex (foyer).       Feel free to keep one. In the book, the work is also referred to as a       “tapestry” on pages 112 and 116, though the usual description was       “wall-hanging”.</p>\n<p>In 1968 Beverley Shore Bennet also designed and executed the Bible Class       banner of St. Michael that stands on a wooden support in the chancel of our       church. This replaces an earlier one by her of one that was stolen in 1967       but retains the style of the original.</p>\n<h4>Windows</h4>\n<p>The stained glass windows in St. Michael’s range in date from 1921 to the       early 1980s. The ten windows fall loosely into two groups: those of English       origin installed during the foundation of the church in the 1920s and those       designed and made mainly in New Zealand, installed from the late 1960s to       the early 1980s, with the remaining window installed in the 1940s. The       styles vary from the Camm Brothers’ diagonally latticed, detailed       compositions to the moments in movement that characterize Beverley Shore       Bennett’s work. Some other New Zealand examples of the work of the Camm       Brothers of Smethwick feature in Fiona Ciaran’s book The Stained Glass       Windows of Canterbury. Beverley Shore Bennett is the only New Zealand woman       to have been made a fellow of the British Society of Master Glass Painters.       She was awarded an MBE in June, 1980. She has completed over five hundred       stained glass window designs throughout New Zealand.</p>\n<p>These stained glass windows are a testament to individuals and communities       associated with St. Michael’s Church over almost a century. They are gifts,       memorials and heritage works, mostly featuring Biblical narratives designed       to teach and inspire. The church architect, Edmund Wilson, wrote of his       desire for the first stained glass windows to be “appropriate in feeling” to       the design of the building. Although stylistically very different,       subsequent windows, echo this sentiment, with the overriding aim of       glorifying God. In Walter Camm’s words, “a window should be not only       beautiful in its detail, but an inspiration to all beholders for all time.”       Beverley Shore Bennett’s consistent approach, in her own words, “has the       starting point of prayer and what follows is God given.”</p>\n<p>If you want to study the windows further – either here in at the church –       the following details may be of use to you…</p>\n<h4>East wall windows – the chancel</h4>\n<p>The church architect, Edmund Wilson of Invercargill, in 1920, expressed a       dual purpose for the stained glass windows of St. Michael’s. His desire was       that they should both be striking works of art and inspire worship. To       Arthur Dixon, in June, Wilson wrote of “getting a result worthy of its high       purpose in these troublous times.” He further wrote of his desire that the       windows should “arrest the attention of the worshippers as they enter the       church.”</p>\n<p>“Lord Bledisloe, a former Governor-General, always maintained that the       finest stained glass in New Zealand was in St. Michael’s.” This comment       relates specifically to the East window and the St. Michael window, and was       made after a visit made in the early 1950s. (This is according to the       unknown writer of St. Michael’s Church, a spiral bound, Croxley ‘Li-Flat’       school exercise book in the Alexander Turnbull Library).</p>\n<h4>The Nativity (The Holy Family and the Shepherds) – east wall, the chancel</h4>\n<p>While they were there (Bethlehem), the time came for her to deliver her       child. And she gave birth to her first born son and wrapped him in bands of       cloth, and laid him in a manger because there was no place for them in the     inn.<span class="smallitalicp"> Luke 2: 6-7</span></p>\n<p>The central light, unveiled in 1921, was given by Mrs Edward Anderson, in       memory of her husband who died in 1919. All three windows were designed by       Walter Camm and executed by Florence, Robert and Walter Camm, for the firm       of Thomas William Camm, The Studio, Smethwick, England. The two sidelights       were unveiled on 30 August 1925. The left light was a parting gift from the       Reverend Arthur Payne and the right was a gift of the Sunday School       children, in memory of those killed in the Great War.</p>\n<p>In the Evening Post, 29 August 1925, an article appears detailing the       unveiling of the windows. It carefully describes the portrayal of the       subject, including the naturalistic detail of “St. Joseph’s sandals thrown       off as he enters the manger.” The article concludes that “the window is       remarkable for the richness of its colour and harmony of tones, and as a       whole depicts the sacred subject of the Nativity with noble reverence and       symbolism full of beautiful meaning.”</p>\n<p>In correspondence between the Reverend Arthur Payne and Walter Camm, some       confusion about the cost was discussed, as the estimate omitted the word       ‘each.’ Walter Camm expressed alarm at “the preposterous duty on British       stained glass for New Zealand.” Also that “since the war, expenses have       increased by leaps and bounds in all directions.” Allowances were made and       the two side lights with bronze saddle bars duly arrived on the R.M.S       Tainui.</p>\n<p><a title="The Nativity (The Holy Family and the Shepards)" rel="lightbox" href="images/History/nativityscene.jpg"><img src="images/History/nativityscene2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60"/></a></p>\n<h4>Touch Me Not, Rabboni – north wall, the nave</h4>\n<p>Jesus said to her, “Do not hold on to me, because I have not yet ascended to       the father.”<span class="smallitalicp"> John 20:17</span></p>\n<p>This double pane depicts The Risen Christ and Mary Magdalene, who emerge       from a pale gold, decorative background. It was given by Mr and Mrs H.C.       Gibbons in memory of their sons, Edward and Walter, killed in the Great War.       It was ordered by the Reverend Arthur Payne, at a total cost of two hundred       and fifty pounds. (Payne retired in August, 1925.) The letter of       authenticity and certification is dated June, 1922. Payne was delighted by       “the simple, though beautiful design, without elaborate details or treatment       of the subject.”</p>\n<p>In St. Michael’s Church, however, the writer wonders why the work was       carried out by James Powell and Sons, Whitefriars, London, instead of the       Camm brothers. He goes on to describe the window as “stereotyped, with       commercialised colour”, and Mary’s purple robe as “quite horrible.” He       wonders at the appropriateness of the design for two young men killed in       action.</p>\n<p>Mr Gibbons, donor of the window, visited James Powell and Sons on 15       December 1921. In a letter to Payne, dated 25 September 1922, from       Bournemouth, Mr Gibbons expresses his clear delight at the finished windows.       “It is difficult for me to express all we feel with regard to the whole of       your arrangements, great thoughtfulness and kindnesses in connection with       the glorious ceremony of the unveiling of the memorial window to our boys.”       The letter is written in a large, flowing script over several backed pages.       Mr Gibbons died on 13 March 1941.</p>\n<p><a title="Touch Me Not, Rabboni" rel="lightbox" href="images/History/Jesusandmary.jpg"><img src="images/History/Jesusandmary2.jpg" alt="Touch Me Not, Rabboni Window" width="863" height="60"/></a></p>\n<h4>St. Michael in Armour – south wall, the chancel</h4>\n<p>“And war broke out in Heaven; Michael and his angels fought against the       dragon.”<span class="smallitalicp"> Revelation 12: 7</span></p>\n<p>The St. Michael window occupies the traditional place for the name window.

This event is       recorded in the National Library archives of the Evening Post.</p>\n<p>In 1940 a strong earthquake irrecoverably damaged the nave (main section of       the church where the pews are). Despite war time austerity that part of the       church was rebuilt by 1942. Further strengthening of the brick work wasn’t       carried out until 2002!</p>\n<h4>Banners</h4>\n<p>The four fabric banners hanging over the nave of St Michael’s were designed       and made by Bridget Chapman, who was a parishioner, and installed during the       late 1980’s. They speak of the great biblical themes of creation, redemption       and the coming of the Spirit. The larger work hanging on the west wall above       the entrance to the nave, was designed and executed by Beverley Shore       Bennett, who also designed several of the stained glass windows in our       church (see more below on Beverly).</p>\n<p>You can read about the dedication by Mrs Anne Davidson of this wall-hanging       as a memorial to her husband George Davidson on page 112 (and some       historically relevant comment on page 94) of Joan Wood’s book St Michael and       All Angels, Kelburn Copies of which you can find in the narthex (foyer).       Feel free to keep one. In the book, the work is also referred to as a       “tapestry” on pages 112 and 116, though the usual description was       “wall-hanging”.</p>\n<p>In 1968 Beverley Shore Bennet also designed and executed the Bible Class       banner of St. Michael that stands on a wooden support in the chancel of our       church. This replaces an earlier one by her of one that was stolen in 1967       but retains the style of the original.</p>\n<h4>Windows</h4>\n<p>The stained glass windows in St. Michael’s range in date from 1921 to the       early 1980s. The ten windows fall loosely into two groups: those of English       origin installed during the foundation of the church in the 1920s and those       designed and made mainly in New Zealand, installed from the late 1960s to       the early 1980s, with the remaining window installed in the 1940s. The       styles vary from the Camm Brothers’ diagonally latticed, detailed       compositions to the moments in movement that characterize Beverley Shore       Bennett’s work. Some other New Zealand examples of the work of the Camm       Brothers of Smethwick feature in Fiona Ciaran’s book The Stained Glass       Windows of Canterbury. Beverley Shore Bennett is the only New Zealand woman       to have been made a fellow of the British Society of Master Glass Painters.       She was awarded an MBE in June, 1980. She has completed over five hundred       stained glass window designs throughout New Zealand.</p>\n<p>These stained glass windows are a testament to individuals and communities       associated with St. Michael’s Church over almost a century. They are gifts,       memorials and heritage works, mostly featuring Biblical narratives designed       to teach and inspire. The church architect, Edmund Wilson, wrote of his       desire for the first stained glass windows to be “appropriate in feeling” to       the design of the building. Although stylistically very different,       subsequent windows, echo this sentiment, with the overriding aim of       glorifying God. In Walter Camm’s words, “a window should be not only       beautiful in its detail, but an inspiration to all beholders for all time.”       Beverley Shore Bennett’s consistent approach, in her own words, “has the       starting point of prayer and what follows is God given.”</p>\n<p>If you want to study the windows further – either here in at the church –       the following details may be of use to you…</p>\n<h4>East wall windows – the chancel</h4>\n<p>The church architect, Edmund Wilson of Invercargill, in 1920, expressed a       dual purpose for the stained glass windows of St. Michael’s. His desire was       that they should both be striking works of art and inspire worship. To       Arthur Dixon, in June, Wilson wrote of “getting a result worthy of its high       purpose in these troublous times.” He further wrote of his desire that the       windows should “arrest the attention of the worshippers as they enter the       church.”</p>\n<p>“Lord Bledisloe, a former Governor-General, always maintained that the       finest stained glass in New Zealand was in St. Michael’s.” This comment       relates specifically to the East window and the St. Michael window, and was       made after a visit made in the early 1950s. (This is according to the       unknown writer of St. Michael’s Church, a spiral bound, Croxley ‘Li-Flat’       school exercise book in the Alexander Turnbull Library).</p>\n<h4>The Nativity (The Holy Family and the Shepherds) – east wall, the chancel</h4>\n<p>While they were there (Bethlehem), the time came for her to deliver her       child. And she gave birth to her first born son and wrapped him in bands of       cloth, and laid him in a manger because there was no place for them in the     inn.<span class="smallitalicp"> Luke 2: 6-7</span></p>\n<p>The central light, unveiled in 1921, was given by Mrs Edward Anderson, in       memory of her husband who died in 1919. All three windows were designed by       Walter Camm and executed by Florence, Robert and Walter Camm, for the firm       of Thomas William Camm, The Studio, Smethwick, England. The two sidelights       were unveiled on 30 August 1925. The left light was a parting gift from the       Reverend Arthur Payne and the right was a gift of the Sunday School       children, in memory of those killed in the Great War.</p>\n<p>In the Evening Post, 29 August 1925, an article appears detailing the       unveiling of the windows. It carefully describes the portrayal of the       subject, including the naturalistic detail of “St. Joseph’s sandals thrown       off as he enters the manger.” The article concludes that “the window is       remarkable for the richness of its colour and harmony of tones, and as a       whole depicts the sacred subject of the Nativity with noble reverence and       symbolism full of beautiful meaning.”</p>\n<p>In correspondence between the Reverend Arthur Payne and Walter Camm, some       confusion about the cost was discussed, as the estimate omitted the word       ‘each.’ Walter Camm expressed alarm at “the preposterous duty on British       stained glass for New Zealand.” Also that “since the war, expenses have       increased by leaps and bounds in all directions.” Allowances were made and       the two side lights with bronze saddle bars duly arrived on the R.M.S       Tainui.</p>\n<p><a title="The Nativity (The Holy Family and the Shepards)" rel="lightbox" href="$ThemeDir/images/History/nativityscene.jpg"><img src="$ThemeDir/images/History/nativityscene2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60"/></a></p>\n<h4>Touch Me Not, Rabboni – north wall, the nave</h4>\n<p>Jesus said to her, “Do not hold on to me, because I have not yet ascended to       the father.”<span class="smallitalicp"> John 20:17</span></p>\n<p>This double pane depicts The Risen Christ and Mary Magdalene, who emerge       from a pale gold, decorative background. It was given by Mr and Mrs H.C.       Gibbons in memory of their sons, Edward and Walter, killed in the Great War.       It was ordered by the Reverend Arthur Payne, at a total cost of two hundred       and fifty pounds. (Payne retired in August, 1925.) The letter of       authenticity and certification is dated June, 1922. Payne was delighted by       “the simple, though beautiful design, without elaborate details or treatment       of the subject.”</p>\n<p>In St. Michael’s Church, however, the writer wonders why the work was       carried out by James Powell and Sons, Whitefriars, London, instead of the       Camm brothers. He goes on to describe the window as “stereotyped, with       commercialised colour”, and Mary’s purple robe as “quite horrible.” He       wonders at the appropriateness of the design for two young men killed in       action.</p>\n<p>Mr Gibbons, donor of the window, visited James Powell and Sons on 15       December 1921. In a letter to Payne, dated 25 September 1922, from       Bournemouth, Mr Gibbons expresses his clear delight at the finished windows.       “It is difficult for me to express all we feel with regard to the whole of       your arrangements, great thoughtfulness and kindnesses in connection with       the glorious ceremony of the unveiling of the memorial window to our boys.”       The letter is written in a large, flowing script over several backed pages.       Mr Gibbons died on 13 March 1941.</p>\n<p><a title="Touch Me Not, Rabboni" rel="lightbox" href="$ThemeDir/images/History/Jesusandmary.jpg"><img src="$ThemeDir/images/History/Jesusandmary2.jpg" alt="Touch Me Not, Rabboni Window" width="863" height="60"/></a></p>\n<h4>St. Michael in Armour – south wall, the chancel</h4>\n<p>“And war broke out in Heaven; Michael and his angels fought against the       dragon.”<span class="smallitalicp"> Revelation 12: 7</span></p>\n<p>The St. Michael window occupies the traditional place for the name window.       It was unveiled on 2 October 1927. The design chosen was a portion of a       window done in memory of the squire of Meriden parish, near Coventry,       England – Captain Bankes, who was killed in the retreat from Mons.</p>\n<p>The original drawing was painted by Florence Camm, with the assistance of       Robert and Walter Camm. In the draft history of the parish, the subject is       described as St Michael “striking down the dragon which symbolises the power       of evil.”</p>\n<p><a title="St. Michael in Armour" rel="lightbox" href="$ThemeDir/images/History/stmicheals.jpg"><img src="$ThemeDir/images/History/stmicheals2.jpg" alt="St. Michael in Armour Window" width="863" height="60"/></a></p>\n<h4>Blessed are the Pure – north wall, the chancel</h4>\n<p>“Blessed are the pure in heart for they will see God.”<span class="smallitalicp"> Matthew 5:8</span></p>\n<p>This is the only window in St. Michael’s that does not have a Biblical       narrative for its subject. Dedicated in March, 1944, the Flanagan window was       erected in memory of their daughter Shirley Isobel, who died in 1939, aged       19.</p>\n<p>Walter Camm, who manufactured the window, described its subject as “Blessed       are the pure in heart for they shall see God.” He further related the       subject to Shirley in the Madonna lilies representing purity, the spinning       wheel, domestic duties and the medallion of harp and scroll to Shirley’s       musical tastes and talents.</p>\n<p><a title="Blessed are the Pure" rel="lightbox" href="$ThemeDir/images/History/Blessedarethepure.jpg"><img src="$ThemeDir/images/History/Blessedarethepure2.jpg" alt="Blessed are the Pure Window" width="863" height="60"/></a></p>\n<h4>St. Raphael – south wall, the chancel</h4>\n<p>“I am one of the seven holy angels, which present the prayers of the saints,       and go in before the glory of the Holy One.” <span class="smallitalicp">Tobit 12:15</span></p>\n<p>Given by Mrs Evelyn Marsack in memory of her son Nigel and of her parents,       Frank and Etta Robins. It was made in 1980, by Paul Hutchins of Miller       Studios in Dunedin, and dedicated in 1981. The window depicts St. Raphael,       one of the three archangels named in the Jewish scriptures. In the story of       Tobit, Raphael uses a fish that is caught to both heal and repel evil.</p>\n<p>Symbolically, the fish can also represent the church, the Greek word IXTHUS       meaning both ‘fish’ and the words “Jesus Christ son of God Saviour”. Both       the shoulder pouch and the medical symbol in the bottom left corner refer to       his ministry of healing. St. Raphael steps towards us in swirling garments,       characteristic of Beverley Shore Bennett’s style and what she describes as       her “swoops and swishes”.</p>\n<p><a title="St. Raphael" rel="lightbox" href="$ThemeDir/images/History/raphael.jpg"><img src="$ThemeDir/images/History/raphael2.jpg" alt="St. Raphael Window" width="863" height="60"/></a></p>\n<h4>The Prodigal Son (I am the Good Shepherd) – south wall, the nave</h4>\n<p>“This son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found!”<span class="smallitalicp"> Luke 15:24</span></p>\n<p>Gifted by Mr and Mrs George Davidson in memory of their parents. The window       was dedicated by the Bishop of Wellington, on Jubilee Sunday, 1 October       1967, fifty years after St. Michael’s was declared a parochial district.</p>\n<p>The windows were designed by Mr Pilgrim Wheton and made in Australia. They       depict the Prodigal Son and The Good Shepherd. The style is linear, with       stylised figures presented with bright clarity. In the two windows beside       this, Beverley Shore Bennett consciously followed the same compositional       format of a series of frames.</p>\n<p><a title="The Prodigal Son" rel="lightbox" href="$ThemeDir/images/History/prodigolson.jpg"><img src="$ThemeDir/images/History/prodigalson2.jpg" alt="The Prodigal Son" width="863" height="60"/></a></p>\n<h4>The Good Samaritan (The True Vine, Love One Another) – south wall, the nave</h4>\n<p>“But a Samaritan while travelling came near him; and when he saw him, he was       moved with pity.”<span class="smallitalicp"> Luke 10:33</span></p>\n<p>This window was gifted by Mrs Maude Haines in memory of John Frederick Mayo,       acting vicar (August 1940-April 1946). It was dedicated by Bishop MacKenzie       at the Patronal Festival, 26 September 1971. The window was designed by       Beverley Shore Bennett, who arranged for its manufacture by Roy Miller of       Miller and Sons, Dunedin. The windows depict the story of The Good Samaritan       in four circular frames. Biblical text features throughout the windows, with       the new commandment to “love one another” at the top. The windows present       both a central truth in Christ’s teaching as well as a tribute to the life       and work of Mayo.</p>\n<p><a title="The Good Samaritan" rel="lightbox" href="$ThemeDir/images/History/goodsamaritan.jpg"><img src="$ThemeDir/images/History/goodsamaritan2.jpg" alt="The Good Samaritan Window" width="863" height="60"/></a></p>\n<h4>The Parable of the Sower (Secrets of the Kingdom of God, The Mustard Seed) –       south wall, the nave</h4>\n<p>“But as for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word       and understands it, who indeed bears fruit.” <span class="smallitalicp">Matthew 13:23</span></p>\n<p>Installed in 1981, this window is in memory of Dorothy Cowell Hentry and was       paid for out of her generous legacy. This window depicts the parable of the       sower and what that parable reveals about the Kingdom of Heaven. Biblical       text is interspersed between the frames. It echoes the simple design of The       Prodigal Son in its storybook format. The windows were designed by Beverley       Shore Bennett and made by Paul Hutchins of Miller Studios, Dunedin.</p>\n<p><a title="The Parable of the Sower(Secrets of the Kingdom of God, The Mustar Seed)" rel="lightbox" href="$ThemeDir/images/History/sower.jpg"><img src="$ThemeDir/images/History/sower2.jpg" alt="The Parable of the Sower Window" width="863" height="60"/></a></p>\n<h4>The Crucifixion (Truly this was the Son of God) – north wall, the nave</h4>\n<p>Now when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that in this way he       breathed his last, he said, “Truly this man was God’s son!”<span class="smallitalicp"> Mark 15:39</span></p>\n<p>This window depicts the crucified Christ on a dramatic red background. The       contrasting left panel is predominantly rich blues, focussed in Mary’s       garment. The window is in memory of Maude Haines who died on the 29       September 1971, her bequest covering most of the cost of the narthex. The       vestry decided to place another window in St. Michael’s, “a project dear to       the heart of Mrs Haines.” The window was installed and consecrated in       1975/6.</p>\n<p>The coloured drawing (watercolour) for the Crucifixion windows, designed by       Beverley Shore Bennett, is in the Alexander Turnbull Library.       Characteristically, the lead is clearly a part of the design and relates to       the subject for effect, rather than functioning independently. As a result,       both sides are connected and flow into each other. The windows were made by       Roy Miller of Miller Studios, Dunedin. Roy Miller retired in 1981.</p>\n<p><a title="The Crucifixion (Truely this was the Son of God)" rel="lightbox" href="$ThemeDir/images/History/CRUCIFIXION.jpg"><img src="$ThemeDir/images/History/CRUCIFIXION2.jpg" alt="The Crucifixion Window" width="863" height="60"/></a></p>\n<h4>The Transfiguration (Jesus Appears, The Disciples) – north wall, the nave</h4>\n<p>“Jesus took with him Peter and James and his brother John and led them up a       high mountain by themselves. And he was transfigured before them, and his       face shone like the sun, and his clothes became dazzling white.”<span class="smallitalicp"> Matthew       17:1-2</span></p>\n<p>The window is dedicated to Max Willacy-Kuhn (11 September 1904 – 24 February       1975). It was designed by Beverley Shore Bennett and installed towards the       end of 1977 by his widow and family. Mrs Elizabeth Wallacy-Kuhn described       the subject of the Transfiguration as “a powerful symbol of the emergent,       immaculate Christ”. Personal detail is also reflected in the choice of the       predominant blue, Mr Willacy-Kuhn’s favourite colour, in contrast with the       “homespun brown colours of the kneeling disciples”, so bringing heaven and       earth together.</p>\n<p><a title="The Transfiguration (Jesus Appears, The Disciples)" rel="lightbox" href="$ThemeDir/images/History/transfigaration.jpg"><img src="$ThemeDir/images/History/transfigaration2.jpg" alt="The Transfiguration Window" width="863" height="60"/></a></p>', 'History', NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, 1, NULL, 0, 1, 0, 0, 'Published', NULL, 'Inherit', 'Inherit', NULL, 29);

He goes on to describe the window as “stereotyped, with       commercialised colour”, and Mary’s purple robe as “quite horrible.” He       wonders at the appropriateness of the design for two young men killed in       action.</p>\n<p>Mr Gibbons, donor of the window, visited James Powell and Sons on 15       December 1921. In a letter to Payne, dated 25 September 1922, from       Bournemouth, Mr Gibbons expresses his clear delight at the finished windows.       “It is difficult for me to express all we feel with regard to the whole of       your arrangements, great thoughtfulness and kindnesses in connection with       the glorious ceremony of the unveiling of the memorial window to our boys.”       The letter is written in a large, flowing script over several backed pages.       Mr Gibbons died on 13 March 1941.</p>\n<p><a title="Touch Me Not, Rabboni" rel="lightbox" href="$ThemeDir/images/History/Jesusandmary.jpg"><img src="$ThemeDir/images/History/Jesusandmary2.jpg" alt="Touch Me Not, Rabboni Window" width="863" height="60"/></a></p>\n<h4>St. Michael in Armour – south wall, the chancel</h4>\n<p>“And war broke out in Heaven; Michael and his angels fought against the       dragon.”<span class="smallitalicp"> Revelation 12: 7</span></p>\n<p>The St. Michael window occupies the traditional place for the name window.

Mrs Elizabeth Wallacy-Kuhn described       the subject of the Transfiguration as “a powerful symbol of the emergent,       immaculate Christ”. Personal detail is also reflected in the choice of the       predominant blue, Mr Willacy-Kuhn’s favourite colour, in contrast with the       “homespun brown colours of the kneeling disciples”, so bringing heaven and       earth together.</p>\n<p><a title="The Transfiguration (Jesus Appears, The Disciples)" rel="lightbox" href="$ThemeDir/images/History/transfigaration.jpg"><img src="$ThemeDir/images/History/transfigaration2.jpg" alt="The Transfiguration Window" width="863" height="60"/></a></p>', 'History', NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, 1, NULL, 0, 1, 0, 0, 'Published', NULL, 'Inherit', 'Inherit', NULL, 29),

Building of the church started in 1912 and the foundation       stone was laid in 1919. This stone is a block of marble inscribed with a       Maltese Cross and the year given in Roman numerals, MCMXIX and can be found       at the east end of the church on St Michael’s Crescent. This event is       recorded in the National Library archives of the Evening Post.</p>\n<p>In 1940 a strong earthquake irrecoverably damaged the nave (main section of       the church where the pews are). Despite war time austerity that part of the       church was rebuilt by 1942. Further strengthening of the brick work wasn’t       carried out until 2002!</p>\n<h4>Banners</h4>\n<p>The four fabric banners hanging over the nave of St Michael’s were designed       and made by Bridget Chapman, who was a parishioner, and installed during the       late 1980’s. They speak of the great biblical themes of creation, redemption       and the coming of the Spirit. The larger work hanging on the west wall above       the entrance to the nave, was designed and executed by Beverley Shore       Bennett, who also designed several of the stained glass windows in our       church (see more below on Beverly).</p>\n<p>You can read about the dedication by Mrs Anne Davidson of this wall-hanging       as a memorial to her husband George Davidson on page 112 (and some       historically relevant comment on page 94) of Joan Wood’s book St Michael and       All Angels, Kelburn Copies of which you can find in the narthex (foyer).       Feel free to keep one. In the book, the work is also referred to as a       “tapestry” on pages 112 and 116, though the usual description was       “wall-hanging”.</p>\n<p>In 1968 Beverley Shore Bennet also designed and executed the Bible Class       banner of St. Michael that stands on a wooden support in the chancel of our       church. This replaces an earlier one by her of one that was stolen in 1967       but retains the style of the original.</p>\n<h4>Windows</h4>\n<p>The stained glass windows in St. Michael’s range in date from 1921 to the       early 1980s. The ten windows fall loosely into two groups: those of English       origin installed during the foundation of the church in the 1920s and those       designed and made mainly in New Zealand, installed from the late 1960s to       the early 1980s, with the remaining window installed in the 1940s. The       styles vary from the Camm Brothers’ diagonally latticed, detailed       compositions to the moments in movement that characterize Beverley Shore       Bennett’s work. Some other New Zealand examples of the work of the Camm       Brothers of Smethwick feature in Fiona Ciaran’s book The Stained Glass       Windows of Canterbury. Beverley Shore Bennett is the only New Zealand woman       to have been made a fellow of the British Society of Master Glass Painters.       She was awarded an MBE in June, 1980. She has completed over five hundred       stained glass window designs throughout New Zealand.</p>\n<p>These stained glass windows are a testament to individuals and communities       associated with St. Michael’s Church over almost a century. They are gifts,       memorials and heritage works, mostly featuring Biblical narratives designed       to teach and inspire. The church architect, Edmund Wilson, wrote of his       desire for the first stained glass windows to be “appropriate in feeling” to       the design of the building. Although stylistically very different,       subsequent windows, echo this sentiment, with the overriding aim of       glorifying God. In Walter Camm’s words, “a window should be not only       beautiful in its detail, but an inspiration to all beholders for all time.”       Beverley Shore Bennett’s consistent approach, in her own words, “has the       starting point of prayer and what follows is God given.”</p>\n<p>If you want to study the windows further – either here in at the church –       the following details may be of use to you…</p>\n<h4>East wall windows – the chancel</h4>\n<p>The church architect, Edmund Wilson of Invercargill, in 1920, expressed a       dual purpose for the stained glass windows of St. Michael’s. His desire was       that they should both be striking works of art and inspire worship. To       Arthur Dixon, in June, Wilson wrote of “getting a result worthy of its high       purpose in these troublous times.” He further wrote of his desire that the       windows should “arrest the attention of the worshippers as they enter the       church.”</p>\n<p>“Lord Bledisloe, a former Governor-General, always maintained that the       finest stained glass in New Zealand was in St. Michael’s.” This comment       relates specifically to the East window and the St. Michael window, and was       made after a visit made in the early 1950s. (This is according to the       unknown writer of St. Michael’s Church, a spiral bound, Croxley ‘Li-Flat’       school exercise book in the Alexander Turnbull Library).</p>\n<h4>The Nativity (The Holy Family and the Shepherds) – east wall, the chancel</h4>\n<p>While they were there (Bethlehem), the time came for her to deliver her       child. And she gave birth to her first born son and wrapped him in bands of       cloth, and laid him in a manger because there was no place for them in the     inn.<span class="smallitalicp"> Luke 2: 6-7</span></p>\n<p>The central light, unveiled in 1921, was given by Mrs Edward Anderson, in       memory of her husband who died in 1919. All three windows were designed by       Walter Camm and executed by Florence, Robert and Walter Camm, for the firm       of Thomas William Camm, The Studio, Smethwick, England. The two sidelights       were unveiled on 30 August 1925. The left light was a parting gift from the       Reverend Arthur Payne and the right was a gift of the Sunday School       children, in memory of those killed in the Great War.</p>\n<p>In the Evening Post, 29 August 1925, an article appears detailing the       unveiling of the windows. It carefully describes the portrayal of the       subject, including the naturalistic detail of “St. Joseph’s sandals thrown       off as he enters the manger.” The article concludes that “the window is       remarkable for the richness of its colour and harmony of tones, and as a       whole depicts the sacred subject of the Nativity with noble reverence and       symbolism full of beautiful meaning.”</p>\n<p>In correspondence between the Reverend Arthur Payne and Walter Camm, some       confusion about the cost was discussed, as the estimate omitted the word       ‘each.’ Walter Camm expressed alarm at “the preposterous duty on British       stained glass for New Zealand.” Also that “since the war, expenses have       increased by leaps and bounds in all directions.” Allowances were made and       the two side lights with bronze saddle bars duly arrived on the R.M.S       Tainui.</p>\n<p><img class="left" src="assets/history-photos/nativityscene2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></p>\n<h4>Touch Me Not, Rabboni – north wall, the nave</h4>\n<p>Jesus said to her, “Do not hold on to me, because I have not yet ascended to       the father.”<span class="smallitalicp"> John 20:17</span></p>\n<p>This double pane depicts The Risen Christ and Mary Magdalene, who emerge       from a pale gold, decorative background. It was given by Mr and Mrs H.C.       Gibbons in memory of their sons, Edward and Walter, killed in the Great War.       It was ordered by the Reverend Arthur Payne, at a total cost of two hundred       and fifty pounds. (Payne retired in August, 1925.) The letter of       authenticity and certification is dated June, 1922. Payne was delighted by       “the simple, though beautiful design, without elaborate details or treatment       of the subject.”</p>\n<p>In St. Michael’s Church, however, the writer wonders why the work was       carried out by James Powell and Sons, Whitefriars, London, instead of the       Camm brothers. He goes on to describe the window as “stereotyped, with       commercialised colour”, and Mary’s purple robe as “quite horrible.” He       wonders at the appropriateness of the design for two young men killed in       action.</p>\n<p>Mr Gibbons, donor of the window, visited James Powell and Sons on 15       December 1921. In a letter to Payne, dated 25 September 1922, from       Bournemouth, Mr Gibbons expresses his clear delight at the finished windows.       “It is difficult for me to express all we feel with regard to the whole of       your arrangements, great thoughtfulness and kindnesses in connection with       the glorious ceremony of the unveiling of the memorial window to our boys.”       The letter is written in a large, flowing script over several backed pages.

This stone is a block of marble inscribed with a       Maltese Cross and the year given in Roman numerals, MCMXIX and can be found       at the east end of the church on St Michael’s Crescent.

They speak of the great biblical themes of creation, redemption       and the coming of the Spirit. The larger work hanging on the west wall above       the entrance to the nave, was designed and executed by Beverley Shore       Bennett, who also designed several of the stained glass windows in our       church (see more below on Beverly).</p>\n<p>You can read about the dedication by Mrs Anne Davidson of this wall-hanging       as a memorial to her husband George Davidson on page 112 (and some       historically relevant comment on page 94) of Joan Wood’s book St Michael and       All Angels, Kelburn Copies of which you can find in the narthex (foyer).       Feel free to keep one. In the book, the work is also referred to as a       “tapestry” on pages 112 and 116, though the usual description was       “wall-hanging”.</p>\n<p>In 1968 Beverley Shore Bennet also designed and executed the Bible Class       banner of St. Michael that stands on a wooden support in the chancel of our       church. This replaces an earlier one by her of one that was stolen in 1967       but retains the style of the original.</p>\n<h4>Windows</h4>\n<p>The stained glass windows in St. Michael’s range in date from 1921 to the       early 1980s. The ten windows fall loosely into two groups: those of English       origin installed during the foundation of the church in the 1920s and those       designed and made mainly in New Zealand, installed from the late 1960s to       the early 1980s, with the remaining window installed in the 1940s. The       styles vary from the Camm Brothers’ diagonally latticed, detailed       compositions to the moments in movement that characterize Beverley Shore       Bennett’s work. Some other New Zealand examples of the work of the Camm       Brothers of Smethwick feature in Fiona Ciaran’s book The Stained Glass       Windows of Canterbury. Beverley Shore Bennett is the only New Zealand woman       to have been made a fellow of the British Society of Master Glass Painters.       She was awarded an MBE in June, 1980. She has completed over five hundred       stained glass window designs throughout New Zealand.</p>\n<p>These stained glass windows are a testament to individuals and communities       associated with St. Michael’s Church over almost a century. They are gifts,       memorials and heritage works, mostly featuring Biblical narratives designed       to teach and inspire. The church architect, Edmund Wilson, wrote of his       desire for the first stained glass windows to be “appropriate in feeling” to       the design of the building. Although stylistically very different,       subsequent windows, echo this sentiment, with the overriding aim of       glorifying God. In Walter Camm’s words, “a window should be not only       beautiful in its detail, but an inspiration to all beholders for all time.”       Beverley Shore Bennett’s consistent approach, in her own words, “has the       starting point of prayer and what follows is God given.”</p>\n<p>If you want to study the windows further – either here in at the church –       the following details may be of use to you…</p>\n<h4>East wall windows – the chancel</h4>\n<p>The church architect, Edmund Wilson of Invercargill, in 1920, expressed a       dual purpose for the stained glass windows of St. Michael’s. His desire was       that they should both be striking works of art and inspire worship. To       Arthur Dixon, in June, Wilson wrote of “getting a result worthy of its high       purpose in these troublous times.” He further wrote of his desire that the       windows should “arrest the attention of the worshippers as they enter the       church.”</p>\n<p>“Lord Bledisloe, a former Governor-General, always maintained that the       finest stained glass in New Zealand was in St. Michael’s.” This comment       relates specifically to the East window and the St. Michael window, and was       made after a visit made in the early 1950s. (This is according to the       unknown writer of St. Michael’s Church, a spiral bound, Croxley ‘Li-Flat’       school exercise book in the Alexander Turnbull Library).</p>\n<h4>The Nativity (The Holy Family and the Shepherds) – east wall, the chancel</h4>\n<p>While they were there (Bethlehem), the time came for her to deliver her       child. And she gave birth to her first born son and wrapped him in bands of       cloth, and laid him in a manger because there was no place for them in the     inn.<span class="smallitalicp"> Luke 2: 6-7</span></p>\n<p>The central light, unveiled in 1921, was given by Mrs Edward Anderson, in       memory of her husband who died in 1919. All three windows were designed by       Walter Camm and executed by Florence, Robert and Walter Camm, for the firm       of Thomas William Camm, The Studio, Smethwick, England. The two sidelights       were unveiled on 30 August 1925. The left light was a parting gift from the       Reverend Arthur Payne and the right was a gift of the Sunday School       children, in memory of those killed in the Great War.</p>\n<p>In the Evening Post, 29 August 1925, an article appears detailing the       unveiling of the windows. It carefully describes the portrayal of the       subject, including the naturalistic detail of “St. Joseph’s sandals thrown       off as he enters the manger.” The article concludes that “the window is       remarkable for the richness of its colour and harmony of tones, and as a       whole depicts the sacred subject of the Nativity with noble reverence and       symbolism full of beautiful meaning.”</p>\n<p>In correspondence between the Reverend Arthur Payne and Walter Camm, some       confusion about the cost was discussed, as the estimate omitted the word       ‘each.’ Walter Camm expressed alarm at “the preposterous duty on British       stained glass for New Zealand.” Also that “since the war, expenses have       increased by leaps and bounds in all directions.” Allowances were made and       the two side lights with bronze saddle bars duly arrived on the R.M.S       Tainui.</p>\n<p><img src="assets/history-photos/nativityscene2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></p>\n<h4>Touch Me Not, Rabboni – north wall, the nave</h4>\n<p>Jesus said to her, “Do not hold on to me, because I have not yet ascended to       the father.”<span class="smallitalicp"> John 20:17</span></p>\n<p>This double pane depicts The Risen Christ and Mary Magdalene, who emerge       from a pale gold, decorative background. It was given by Mr and Mrs H.C.       Gibbons in memory of their sons, Edward and Walter, killed in the Great War.       It was ordered by the Reverend Arthur Payne, at a total cost of two hundred       and fifty pounds. (Payne retired in August, 1925.) The letter of       authenticity and certification is dated June, 1922. Payne was delighted by       “the simple, though beautiful design, without elaborate details or treatment       of the subject.”</p>\n<p>In St. Michael’s Church, however, the writer wonders why the work was       carried out by James Powell and Sons, Whitefriars, London, instead of the       Camm brothers. He goes on to describe the window as “stereotyped, with       commercialised colour”, and Mary’s purple robe as “quite horrible.” He       wonders at the appropriateness of the design for two young men killed in       action.</p>\n<p>Mr Gibbons, donor of the window, visited James Powell and Sons on 15       December 1921. In a letter to Payne, dated 25 September 1922, from       Bournemouth, Mr Gibbons expresses his clear delight at the finished windows.       “It is difficult for me to express all we feel with regard to the whole of       your arrangements, great thoughtfulness and kindnesses in connection with       the glorious ceremony of the unveiling of the memorial window to our boys.”       The letter is written in a large, flowing script over several backed pages.       Mr Gibbons died on 13 March 1941.</p>\n<p><img src="assets/history-photos/Jesusandmary2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></p>\n<h4>St. Michael in Armour – south wall, the chancel</h4>\n<p>“And war broke out in Heaven; Michael and his angels fought against the       dragon.”<span class="smallitalicp"> Revelation 12: 7</span></p>\n<p>The St. Michael window occupies the traditional place for the name window.       It was unveiled on 2 October 1927. The design chosen was a portion of a       window done in memory of the squire of Meriden parish, near Coventry,       England – Captain Bankes, who was killed in the retreat from Mons.</p>\n<p>The original drawing was painted by Florence Camm, with the assistance of       Robert and Walter Camm. In the draft history of the parish, the subject is       described as St Michael “striking down the dragon which symbolises the power       of evil.”</p>\n<p><img src="assets/history-photos/stmicheals2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></p>\n<h4>Blessed are the Pure – north wall, the chancel</h4>\n<p>“Blessed are the pure in heart for they will see God.”<span class="smallitalicp"> Matthew 5:8</span></p>\n<p>This is the only window in St. Michael’s that does not have a Biblical       narrative for its subject. Dedicated in March, 1944, the Flanagan window was       erected in memory of their daughter Shirley Isobel, who died in 1939, aged       19.</p>\n<p>Walter Camm, who manufactured the window, described its subject as “Blessed       are the pure in heart for they shall see God.” He further related the       subject to Shirley in the Madonna lilies representing purity, the spinning       wheel, domestic duties and the medallion of harp and scroll to Shirley’s       musical tastes and talents.</p>\n<p><img src="assets/history-photos/Blessedarethepure2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></p>\n<h4>St. Raphael – south wall, the chancel</h4>\n<p>“I am one of the seven holy angels, which present the prayers of the saints,       and go in before the glory of the Holy One.” <span class="smallitalicp">Tobit 12:15</span></p>\n<p>Given by Mrs Evelyn Marsack in memory of her son Nigel and of her parents,       Frank and Etta Robins. It was made in 1980, by Paul Hutchins of Miller       Studios in Dunedin, and dedicated in 1981. The window depicts St. Raphael,       one of the three archangels named in the Jewish scriptures. In the story of       Tobit, Raphael uses a fish that is caught to both heal and repel evil.</p>\n<p>Symbolically, the fish can also represent the church, the Greek word IXTHUS       meaning both ‘fish’ and the words “Jesus Christ son of God Saviour”. Both       the shoulder pouch and the medical symbol in the bottom left corner refer to       his ministry of healing. St. Raphael steps towards us in swirling garments,       characteristic of Beverley Shore Bennett’s style and what she describes as       her “swoops and swishes”.</p>\n<p><img src="assets/history-photos/raphael2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></p>\n<h4>The Prodigal Son (I am the Good Shepherd) – south wall, the nave</h4>\n<p>“This son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found!”<span class="smallitalicp"> Luke 15:24</span></p>\n<p>Gifted by Mr and Mrs George Davidson in memory of their parents. The window       was dedicated by the Bishop of Wellington, on Jubilee Sunday, 1 October       1967, fifty years after St. Michael’s was declared a parochial district.</p>\n<p>The windows were designed by Mr Pilgrim Wheton and made in Australia. They       depict the Prodigal Son and The Good Shepherd. The style is linear, with       stylised figures presented with bright clarity. In the two windows beside       this, Beverley Shore Bennett consciously followed the same compositional       format of a series of frames.</p>\n<p><img src="assets/history-photos/prodigalson2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></p>\n<h4>The Good Samaritan (The True Vine, Love One Another) – south wall, the nave</h4>\n<p>“But a Samaritan while travelling came near him; and when he saw him, he was       moved with pity.”<span class="smallitalicp"> Luke 10:33</span></p>\n<p>This window was gifted by Mrs Maude Haines in memory of John Frederick Mayo,       acting vicar (August 1940-April 1946). It was dedicated by Bishop MacKenzie       at the Patronal Festival, 26 September 1971. The window was designed by       Beverley Shore Bennett, who arranged for its manufacture by Roy Miller of       Miller and Sons, Dunedin. The windows depict the story of The Good Samaritan       in four circular frames. Biblical text features throughout the windows, with       the new commandment to “love one another” at the top. The windows present       both a central truth in Christ’s teaching as well as a tribute to the life       and work of Mayo.</p>\n<p><img src="assets/history-photos/goodsamaritan2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></p>\n<h4>The Parable of the Sower (Secrets of the Kingdom of God, The Mustard Seed) –       south wall, the nave</h4>\n<p>“But as for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word       and understands it, who indeed bears fruit.” <span class="smallitalicp">Matthew 13:23</span></p>\n<p>Installed in 1981, this window is in memory of Dorothy Cowell Hentry and was       paid for out of her generous legacy. This window depicts the parable of the       sower and what that parable reveals about the Kingdom of Heaven. Biblical       text is interspersed between the frames. It echoes the simple design of The       Prodigal Son in its storybook format. The windows were designed by Beverley       Shore Bennett and made by Paul Hutchins of Miller Studios, Dunedin.</p>\n<p><img src="assets/history-photos/sower2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></p>\n<h4>The Crucifixion (Truly this was the Son of God) – north wall, the nave</h4>\n<p>Now when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that in this way he       breathed his last, he said, “Truly this man was God’s son!”<span class="smallitalicp"> Mark 15:39</span></p>\n<p>This window depicts the crucified Christ on a dramatic red background. The       contrasting left panel is predominantly rich blues, focussed in Mary’s       garment. The window is in memory of Maude Haines who died on the 29       September 1971, her bequest covering most of the cost of the narthex. The       vestry decided to place another window in St. Michael’s, “a project dear to       the heart of Mrs Haines.” The window was installed and consecrated in       1975/6.</p>\n<p>The coloured drawing (watercolour) for the Crucifixion windows, designed by       Beverley Shore Bennett, is in the Alexander Turnbull Library.       Characteristically, the lead is clearly a part of the design and relates to       the subject for effect, rather than functioning independently.

It was dedicated by Bishop MacKenzie       at the Patronal Festival, 26 September 1971. The window was designed by       Beverley Shore Bennett, who arranged for its manufacture by Roy Miller of       Miller and Sons, Dunedin. The windows depict the story of The Good Samaritan       in four circular frames. Biblical text features throughout the windows, with       the new commandment to “love one another” at the top. The windows present       both a central truth in Christ’s teaching as well as a tribute to the life       and work of Mayo.</p>\n<p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="assets/history-photos/goodsamaritan.jpg"><img src="assets/history-photos/goodsamaritan2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></a></p>\n<h4>The Parable of the Sower (Secrets of the Kingdom of God, The Mustard Seed) –       south wall, the nave</h4>\n<p>“But as for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word       and understands it, who indeed bears fruit.” <span class="smallitalicp">Matthew 13:23</span></p>\n<p>Installed in 1981, this window is in memory of Dorothy Cowell Hentry and was       paid for out of her generous legacy.

It echoes the simple design of The       Prodigal Son in its storybook format.

The       contrasting left panel is predominantly rich blues, focussed in Mary’s       garment. The window is in memory of Maude Haines who died on the 29       September 1971, her bequest covering most of the cost of the narthex. The       vestry decided to place another window in St. Michael’s, “a project dear to       the heart of Mrs Haines.” The window was installed and consecrated in       1975/6.</p>\n<p>The coloured drawing (watercolour) for the Crucifixion windows, designed by       Beverley Shore Bennett, is in the Alexander Turnbull Library.       Characteristically, the lead is clearly a part of the design and relates to       the subject for effect, rather than functioning independently. As a result,       both sides are connected and flow into each other. The windows were made by       Roy Miller of Miller Studios, Dunedin. Roy Miller retired in 1981.</p>\n<p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="assets/history-photos/CRUCIFIXION2jpg"><img src="assets/history-photos/CRUCIFIXION2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></a></p>\n<h4>The Transfiguration (Jesus Appears, The Disciples) – north wall, the nave</h4>\n<p>“Jesus took with him Peter and James and his brother John and led them up a       high mountain by themselves.

It was designed by Beverley Shore Bennett and installed towards the       end of 1977 by his widow and family. Mrs Elizabeth Wallacy-Kuhn described       the subject of the Transfiguration as “a powerful symbol of the emergent,       immaculate Christ”. Personal detail is also reflected in the choice of the       predominant blue, Mr Willacy-Kuhn’s favourite colour, in contrast with the       “homespun brown colours of the kneeling disciples”, so bringing heaven and       earth together.</p>\n<p><a rel="prettyPhoto" href="assets/history-photos/transfigaration.jpg"><img src="assets/history-photos/transfigaration2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></a></p>', 'History', NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, 1, NULL, 0, 1, 1, 0, 'Published', NULL, 'Inherit', 'Inherit', NULL, 29),

Building of the church started in 1912 and the foundation       stone was laid in 1919. This stone is a block of marble inscribed with a       Maltese Cross and the year given in Roman numerals, MCMXIX and can be found       at the east end of the church on St Michael’s Crescent. This event is       recorded in the National Library archives of the Evening Post.</p>\n<p>In 1940 a strong earthquake irrecoverably damaged the nave (main section of       the church where the pews are). Despite war time austerity that part of the       church was rebuilt by 1942. Further strengthening of the brick work wasn’t       carried out until 2002!</p>\n<h4>Banners</h4>\n<p>The four fabric banners hanging over the nave of St Michael’s were designed       and made by Bridget Chapman, who was a parishioner, and installed during the       late 1980’s. They speak of the great biblical themes of creation, redemption       and the coming of the Spirit. The larger work hanging on the west wall above       the entrance to the nave, was designed and executed by Beverley Shore       Bennett, who also designed several of the stained glass windows in our       church (see more below on Beverly).</p>\n<p>You can read about the dedication by Mrs Anne Davidson of this wall-hanging       as a memorial to her husband George Davidson on page 112 (and some       historically relevant comment on page 94) of Joan Wood’s book St Michael and       All Angels, Kelburn Copies of which you can find in the narthex (foyer).       Feel free to keep one. In the book, the work is also referred to as a       “tapestry” on pages 112 and 116, though the usual description was       “wall-hanging”.</p>\n<p>In 1968 Beverley Shore Bennet also designed and executed the Bible Class       banner of St. Michael that stands on a wooden support in the chancel of our       church. This replaces an earlier one by her of one that was stolen in 1967       but retains the style of the original.</p>\n<h4>Windows</h4>\n<p>The stained glass windows in St. Michael’s range in date from 1921 to the       early 1980s. The ten windows fall loosely into two groups: those of English       origin installed during the foundation of the church in the 1920s and those       designed and made mainly in New Zealand, installed from the late 1960s to       the early 1980s, with the remaining window installed in the 1940s. The       styles vary from the Camm Brothers’ diagonally latticed, detailed       compositions to the moments in movement that characterize Beverley Shore       Bennett’s work. Some other New Zealand examples of the work of the Camm       Brothers of Smethwick feature in Fiona Ciaran’s book The Stained Glass       Windows of Canterbury. Beverley Shore Bennett is the only New Zealand woman       to have been made a fellow of the British Society of Master Glass Painters.       She was awarded an MBE in June, 1980. She has completed over five hundred       stained glass window designs throughout New Zealand.</p>\n<p>These stained glass windows are a testament to individuals and communities       associated with St. Michael’s Church over almost a century. They are gifts,       memorials and heritage works, mostly featuring Biblical narratives designed       to teach and inspire. The church architect, Edmund Wilson, wrote of his       desire for the first stained glass windows to be “appropriate in feeling” to       the design of the building. Although stylistically very different,       subsequent windows, echo this sentiment, with the overriding aim of       glorifying God. In Walter Camm’s words, “a window should be not only       beautiful in its detail, but an inspiration to all beholders for all time.”       Beverley Shore Bennett’s consistent approach, in her own words, “has the       starting point of prayer and what follows is God given.”</p>\n<p>If you want to study the windows further – either here in at the church –       the following details may be of use to you…</p>\n<h4>East wall windows – the chancel</h4>\n<p>The church architect, Edmund Wilson of Invercargill, in 1920, expressed a       dual purpose for the stained glass windows of St. Michael’s. His desire was       that they should both be striking works of art and inspire worship. To       Arthur Dixon, in June, Wilson wrote of “getting a result worthy of its high       purpose in these troublous times.” He further wrote of his desire that the       windows should “arrest the attention of the worshippers as they enter the       church.”</p>\n<p>“Lord Bledisloe, a former Governor-General, always maintained that the       finest stained glass in New Zealand was in St. Michael’s.” This comment       relates specifically to the East window and the St. Michael window, and was       made after a visit made in the early 1950s. (This is according to the       unknown writer of St. Michael’s Church, a spiral bound, Croxley ‘Li-Flat’       school exercise book in the Alexander Turnbull Library).</p>\n<h4>The Nativity (The Holy Family and the Shepherds) – east wall, the chancel</h4>\n<p>While they were there (Bethlehem), the time came for her to deliver her       child. And she gave birth to her first born son and wrapped him in bands of       cloth, and laid him in a manger because there was no place for them in the     inn.<span class="smallitalicp"> Luke 2: 6-7</span></p>\n<p>The central light, unveiled in 1921, was given by Mrs Edward Anderson, in       memory of her husband who died in 1919. All three windows were designed by       Walter Camm and executed by Florence, Robert and Walter Camm, for the firm       of Thomas William Camm, The Studio, Smethwick, England. The two sidelights       were unveiled on 30 August 1925. The left light was a parting gift from the       Reverend Arthur Payne and the right was a gift of the Sunday School       children, in memory of those killed in the Great War.</p>\n<p>In the Evening Post, 29 August 1925, an article appears detailing the       unveiling of the windows.

Building of the church started in 1912 and the foundation       stone was laid in 1919. This stone is a block of marble inscribed with a       Maltese Cross and the year given in Roman numerals, MCMXIX and can be found       at the east end of the church on St Michael’s Crescent. This event is       recorded in the National Library archives of the Evening Post.</p>\n<p>In 1940 a strong earthquake irrecoverably damaged the nave (main section of       the church where the pews are). Despite war time austerity that part of the       church was rebuilt by 1942. Further strengthening of the brick work wasn’t       carried out until 2002!</p>\n<h4>Banners</h4>\n<p>The four fabric banners hanging over the nave of St Michael’s were designed       and made by Bridget Chapman, who was a parishioner, and installed during the       late 1980’s. They speak of the great biblical themes of creation, redemption       and the coming of the Spirit. The larger work hanging on the west wall above       the entrance to the nave, was designed and executed by Beverley Shore       Bennett, who also designed several of the stained glass windows in our       church (see more below on Beverly).</p>\n<p>You can read about the dedication by Mrs Anne Davidson of this wall-hanging       as a memorial to her husband George Davidson on page 112 (and some       historically relevant comment on page 94) of Joan Wood’s book St Michael and       All Angels, Kelburn Copies of which you can find in the narthex (foyer).       Feel free to keep one. In the book, the work is also referred to as a       “tapestry” on pages 112 and 116, though the usual description was       “wall-hanging”.</p>\n<p>In 1968 Beverley Shore Bennet also designed and executed the Bible Class       banner of St. Michael that stands on a wooden support in the chancel of our       church. This replaces an earlier one by her of one that was stolen in 1967       but retains the style of the original.</p>\n<h4>Windows</h4>\n<p>The stained glass windows in St. Michael’s range in date from 1921 to the       early 1980s. The ten windows fall loosely into two groups: those of English       origin installed during the foundation of the church in the 1920s and those       designed and made mainly in New Zealand, installed from the late 1960s to       the early 1980s, with the remaining window installed in the 1940s. The       styles vary from the Camm Brothers’ diagonally latticed, detailed       compositions to the moments in movement that characterize Beverley Shore       Bennett’s work. Some other New Zealand examples of the work of the Camm       Brothers of Smethwick feature in Fiona Ciaran’s book The Stained Glass       Windows of Canterbury. Beverley Shore Bennett is the only New Zealand woman       to have been made a fellow of the British Society of Master Glass Painters.       She was awarded an MBE in June, 1980. She has completed over five hundred       stained glass window designs throughout New Zealand.</p>\n<p>These stained glass windows are a testament to individuals and communities       associated with St. Michael’s Church over almost a century. They are gifts,       memorials and heritage works, mostly featuring Biblical narratives designed       to teach and inspire. The church architect, Edmund Wilson, wrote of his       desire for the first stained glass windows to be “appropriate in feeling” to       the design of the building. Although stylistically very different,       subsequent windows, echo this sentiment, with the overriding aim of       glorifying God. In Walter Camm’s words, “a window should be not only       beautiful in its detail, but an inspiration to all beholders for all time.”       Beverley Shore Bennett’s consistent approach, in her own words, “has the       starting point of prayer and what follows is God given.”</p>\n<p>If you want to study the windows further – either here in at the church –       the following details may be of use to you…</p>\n<h4>East wall windows – the chancel</h4>\n<p>The church architect, Edmund Wilson of Invercargill, in 1920, expressed a       dual purpose for the stained glass windows of St. Michael’s. His desire was       that they should both be striking works of art and inspire worship. To       Arthur Dixon, in June, Wilson wrote of “getting a result worthy of its high       purpose in these troublous times.” He further wrote of his desire that the       windows should “arrest the attention of the worshippers as they enter the       church.”</p>\n<p>“Lord Bledisloe, a former Governor-General, always maintained that the       finest stained glass in New Zealand was in St. Michael’s.” This comment       relates specifically to the East window and the St. Michael window, and was       made after a visit made in the early 1950s. (This is according to the       unknown writer of St. Michael’s Church, a spiral bound, Croxley ‘Li-Flat’       school exercise book in the Alexander Turnbull Library).</p>\n<h4>The Nativity (The Holy Family and the Shepherds) – east wall, the chancel</h4>\n<p>While they were there (Bethlehem), the time came for her to deliver her       child. And she gave birth to her first born son and wrapped him in bands of       cloth, and laid him in a manger because there was no place for them in the     inn.<span class="smallitalicp"> Luke 2: 6-7</span></p>\n<p>The central light, unveiled in 1921, was given by Mrs Edward Anderson, in       memory of her husband who died in 1919. All three windows were designed by       Walter Camm and executed by Florence, Robert and Walter Camm, for the firm       of Thomas William Camm, The Studio, Smethwick, England. The two sidelights       were unveiled on 30 August 1925. The left light was a parting gift from the       Reverend Arthur Payne and the right was a gift of the Sunday School       children, in memory of those killed in the Great War.</p>\n<p>In the Evening Post, 29 August 1925, an article appears detailing the       unveiling of the windows. It carefully describes the portrayal of the       subject, including the naturalistic detail of “St. Joseph’s sandals thrown       off as he enters the manger.” The article concludes that “the window is       remarkable for the richness of its colour and harmony of tones, and as a       whole depicts the sacred subject of the Nativity with noble reverence and       symbolism full of beautiful meaning.”</p>\n<p>In correspondence between the Reverend Arthur Payne and Walter Camm, some       confusion about the cost was discussed, as the estimate omitted the word       ‘each.’ Walter Camm expressed alarm at “the preposterous duty on British       stained glass for New Zealand.” Also that “since the war, expenses have       increased by leaps and bounds in all directions.” Allowances were made and       the two side lights with bronze saddle bars duly arrived on the R.M.S       Tainui.</p>\n<p><a rel="prettyPhoto[gallery]" href="assets/history-photos/nativityscene.jpg"><img src="assets/history-photos/nativityscene2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></a></p>\n<h4>Touch Me Not, Rabboni – north wall, the nave</h4>\n<p>Jesus said to her, “Do not hold on to me, because I have not yet ascended to       the father.”<span class="smallitalicp"> John 20:17</span></p>\n<p>This double pane depicts The Risen Christ and Mary Magdalene, who emerge       from a pale gold, decorative background. It was given by Mr and Mrs H.C.       Gibbons in memory of their sons, Edward and Walter, killed in the Great War.       It was ordered by the Reverend Arthur Payne, at a total cost of two hundred       and fifty pounds. (Payne retired in August, 1925.) The letter of       authenticity and certification is dated June, 1922. Payne was delighted by       “the simple, though beautiful design, without elaborate details or treatment       of the subject.”</p>\n<p>In St. Michael’s Church, however, the writer wonders why the work was       carried out by James Powell and Sons, Whitefriars, London, instead of the       Camm brothers. He goes on to describe the window as “stereotyped, with       commercialised colour”, and Mary’s purple robe as “quite horrible.” He       wonders at the appropriateness of the design for two young men killed in       action.</p>\n<p>Mr Gibbons, donor of the window, visited James Powell and Sons on 15       December 1921. In a letter to Payne, dated 25 September 1922, from       Bournemouth, Mr Gibbons expresses his clear delight at the finished windows.       “It is difficult for me to express all we feel with regard to the whole of       your arrangements, great thoughtfulness and kindnesses in connection with       the glorious ceremony of the unveiling of the memorial window to our boys.”       The letter is written in a large, flowing script over several backed pages.       Mr Gibbons died on 13 March 1941.</p>\n<p><a rel="prettyPhoto[gallery]" href="assets/history-photos/Jesusandmary.jpg"><img src="assets/history-photos/Jesusandmary2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></a></p>\n<h4>St. Michael in Armour – south wall, the chancel</h4>\n<p>“And war broke out in Heaven; Michael and his angels fought against the       dragon.”<span class="smallitalicp"> Revelation 12: 7</span></p>\n<p>The St. Michael window occupies the traditional place for the name window.       It was unveiled on 2 October 1927. The design chosen was a portion of a       window done in memory of the squire of Meriden parish, near Coventry,       England – Captain Bankes, who was killed in the retreat from Mons.</p>\n<p>The original drawing was painted by Florence Camm, with the assistance of       Robert and Walter Camm. In the draft history of the parish, the subject is       described as St Michael “striking down the dragon which symbolises the power       of evil.”</p>\n<p><a rel="prettyPhoto[gallery]" href="assets/history-photos/stmicheals.jpg"><img src="assets/history-photos/stmicheals2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></a></p>\n<h4>Blessed are the Pure – north wall, the chancel</h4>\n<p>“Blessed are the pure in heart for they will see God.”<span class="smallitalicp"> Matthew 5:8</span></p>\n<p>This is the only window in St. Michael’s that does not have a Biblical       narrative for its subject. Dedicated in March, 1944, the Flanagan window was       erected in memory of their daughter Shirley Isobel, who died in 1939, aged       19.</p>\n<p>Walter Camm, who manufactured the window, described its subject as “Blessed       are the pure in heart for they shall see God.” He further related the       subject to Shirley in the Madonna lilies representing purity, the spinning       wheel, domestic duties and the medallion of harp and scroll to Shirley’s       musical tastes and talents.</p>\n<p><a rel="prettyPhoto[gallery]" href="assets/history-photos/Blessedarethepure.jpg"><img src="assets/history-photos/Blessedarethepure2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></a></p>\n<h4>St. Raphael – south wall, the chancel</h4>\n<p>“I am one of the seven holy angels, which present the prayers of the saints,       and go in before the glory of the Holy One.” <span class="smallitalicp">Tobit 12:15</span></p>\n<p>Given by Mrs Evelyn Marsack in memory of her son Nigel and of her parents,       Frank and Etta Robins. It was made in 1980, by Paul Hutchins of Miller       Studios in Dunedin, and dedicated in 1981. The window depicts St. Raphael,       one of the three archangels named in the Jewish scriptures. In the story of       Tobit, Raphael uses a fish that is caught to both heal and repel evil.</p>\n<p>Symbolically, the fish can also represent the church, the Greek word IXTHUS       meaning both ‘fish’ and the words “Jesus Christ son of God Saviour”. Both       the shoulder pouch and the medical symbol in the bottom left corner refer to       his ministry of healing. St. Raphael steps towards us in swirling garments,       characteristic of Beverley Shore Bennett’s style and what she describes as       her “swoops and swishes”.</p>\n<p><a rel="prettyPhoto[gallery]" href="assets/history-photos/raphael.jpg"><img src="assets/history-photos/raphael2.jpg" alt="The Nativity Window" width="863" height="60" title=""/></a></p>\n<h4>The Prodigal Son (I am the Good Shepherd) – south wall, the nave</h4>\n<p>“This son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found!”<span class="smallitalicp"> Luke 15:24</span></p>\n<p>Gifted by Mr and Mrs George Davidson in memory of their parents.
