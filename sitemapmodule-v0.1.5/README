If you have any issues, chase me up on the silverstripe IRC channel (http://doc.silverstripe.org/doku.php?id=irc)

Installation Instructions
-----------------------------------------------
1. 	Place this directory in the root of your SilverStripe installation
	i.e. you will now have the following root folders

	assets
	mysite
	cms
	sapphire
	sitemapmodule

2. 	Visit http://www.yoursite.com/dev/build in your browser (where yoursite.com refers to the URL of your SilverStripe site)

3. Change Page Title, Page URL, Hidden Classes, Permissions Check and Theme as below.

Usage Overview
-----------------------------------------------

PLEASE NOTE: Nothing is added to the CMS - your site map will appear when you visit http://www.yoursite.com/site-map/ (This URL can be changed as detailed below).

The following configuration options are available:

SITE MAP PAGE TITLE
	Add the following line to your _config.php to override the default Title for the site map page. Uses 'Site Map' by default.
	
	SiteMapModule::setTitle('Site Map');
	
SITE MAP URL
	Add the following line to your _config.php to override the default URL Segment for the site map. Uses 'site-map' by default.
	
	SiteMapModule::setURLSegment('site-map');
	
HIDE PAGE TYPES FROM THE SITE MAP
	Add the following line to your _config.php to override the default page types that are skipped when rendering the site map.
	Page classes *must* be passed as an array, even when only skipping a single class.
	
	SiteMapModule::skipPageTypes(array(
		"ErrorPage",
		"OtherPage",
		"OtherPage"
	));

CHECK USER PERMISSIONS AND HIDE PAGES THE USER CAN'T VIEW
	Add the following line to your _config.php to do a permissions check to ensure only pages the user is allowed to view are shown.
	Can either be true (will check permissions) or false (will not check permissions).

	SiteMapModule::setPermissionCheck(true);
	
SITE MAP THEME
	Add the following line to your _config.php to switch the theme from the default minimal theme to slickmap:
	Either set the theme name to 'default' or remove the SiteMapModule::setTheme line from your _config.php to switch back to the default theme.

	SiteMapModule::setTheme('slickmap');
