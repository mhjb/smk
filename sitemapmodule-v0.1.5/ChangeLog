SiteMapModule ChangeLog

0.1
  - Initial release

0.1.1
  - Update for Silverstripe 2.4 Release specifically fixing the URLs of nested pages.

0.1.5
  - Change the way the site map gets children to allow displaying data objects.
	Now uses $this->Children to get child pages rather than querying the SiteTree table directly.
	This allows Children() function to be overwritten on a page class to return other pages or data objects to be displayed on the site tree.
  - Pages to be skipped are now included as an array rather than a string with sql syntax.
  - Optimised images
  - Cleaned up code, documentation, license and added more comments
