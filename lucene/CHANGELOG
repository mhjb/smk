Silverstripe Lucene 0.4 - 11 April 2011
=======================================
Added dependency on 'queuedjobs' module.
Reindex will now restart if it times out.
Moved all text extraction into external classes that can be plugged in, allowing 
more to be written by third parties.
Changed indexing of relations to be recursive - you can nest as deep as you like
now.
Updated documentation.
Added field-level configuration and more class-level configuration options.
